Steak vs Steak,"Jun 22, 2018",4338,178,1033862,"I've ALWAYS wanted to do a steak comparison video and these were both insanely delicious Ribeye! I will admit, the prime ribeye is definitely a ""cut"" above the choice, but it was really hard because the choice had the bone still on it so it was a very close contest. The biggest difference between these two qualities of meat is the amount of fat that they each contain...BUT (and this is a big BUT) sometimes the quality check is a little wonky and I've seen choice steak look way way better than some prime cuts, so its really up to the consumer to find the type of meat they're looking for. Make sure to look through all the cuts before buying because there's always one or two that are better than the rest no mater the labeling.

MY DRUNK KITCHEN: Whoopie Pie,"Aug 1, 2017",12520,124,557466,"Dear Internet Fam, Last week I posted a video briefly discussing my support of the transgender community and announcing the paperback cover of my book. My intention was not to exploit the transgender community in any way. I am sorry. I’m working on a separate video to discuss transgender topics in a more thorough manner. This episode of My Drunk Kitchen is simply my way of processing last week and offering an apology to those in our community who felt offended. Upsetting anyone in our community weighs heavily on my heart. For those who have decided they can no longer respect me or the work I do towards progress - I understand. From me I’d like to say that you’re always welcome here if someday you choose to return. “Good Enough” shirts available here: https://store.dftba.com/collections/n..."

Then, add the sugar and spice, ensuring that you mix them in well. Beat the eggs briefly before also adding to them to the mix.Add flour a little at a time, mixing well between each handful. Pour in the black treacle as you go. A little warm water can be used to get the last of the black treacle out of the bowl. Then, add a pinch of bicarbonate of soda to the warm milk before pouring it into the middle of the bowl and mixing everything together.Once the mixture is smooth, line a tin with butter and brown paper before pouring the mixture in. Place in the oven for about an hour at 180 degrees Celsius (an inserted knife or skewer should come out clean once the cake is cooked). Once ready, turn out the cake and leave it to cool, then cut into small pieces to serve.

How to Make Trifle - The Victorian Way,"Jun 29, 2018",69922,1659,7611864,"Mrs Crocombe is making trifle - one of Lord Braybrooke's favourite desserts. It's the perfect treat to follow any meal.INGREDIENTS100g leftover sponge cake100g ratafia biscuits or macaroons50 ml brandy 125ml port or sherry1 teacup of jam100g crystallized fruit, such as ginger and cherries500ml custard (you need to add either 2x sheets of gelatine or 2 tbsp of cornflour to it when you are making it so that it will set) 100g ground almonds1 ¼ pints whipping cream1tbsp caster sugarFor the decoration:Slivered blanched almondsSmall cubes of crystallised fruitAnything else you like (flowers are always nice - but be careful to choose edible varieties as some varieties of flowers can be dangerous to eat)METHODCut your sponge cake into slices. This recipe is excellent for using up leftover sponge cake. You may prefer to use a fatless sponge as it is slightly lighter. Layer these into a deep glass dish, and pour over the brandy.Spread your jam on top – you can use whatever flavor you like.Chop your fruit and add this in an even layer on top. Now add your macaroons or ratifia biscuits, and over this pour your port or sherry.Leave this to soak for 10-15 minutes. If you haven’t any custard to hand, this is the time to make it. The custard needs to set, so if it’s not got gelatin in, reheat and add 2 sheets (soaked first), or whisk up cornflour in a little milk, and add it to the hot custard. Add your ground almonds and allow to cool to room temperature then spread over your trifle evenly.Whip the cream into soft peaks for piping and add some sugar. Pipe this onto your custard, building up layers of cream. Decorate your trifle using almonds, crystallised fruit and edible flowers.

How to Make Marbled Eggs for Easter - The Victorian Way,"Mar 23, 2018",31409,425,7611864,"If you'd like to try this recipe at home, make sure to be very careful when handling/blowing the eggs. In some countries chickens are not vaccinated against salmonella so we suggest giving the eggs a good wash in boiling water and take care not to get any raw egg in your mouth. This recipe for Marbled Eggs would have been served as a sweet ‘entremets’ - small dishes served before dessert. This particular version uses a sweetened cream filling with chocolate and vanilla, but you could use any flavour you like or experiment with different colour jellies.How to make Marbled EggsThis makes enough mixture to fill around six medium sized eggs.  INGREDIENTS600ml double cream7 leaves of gelatine soaked in cold water2 tbsp granulated sugar2 tbsp chopped chocolate A few drops of vanilla extractAround 6 medium sized eggsCrushed iceSome flour and water paste METHODHeat the cream in a pan to just below boiling.Add the sugar, and stir thoroughly until it has dissolved.Mix in the gelatine until it is completely incorporated.Pour half of this cream mixture into a jug, and add your vanilla extract to it.Add your chocolate to the other cream mixture on the hob, and whisk it on a very low heat until it has melted. Pour this into another jug.Allow both mixes to cool to room temperature.Pierce a hole in the top and bottom of one of the eggs, enlarge the hole in bottom to around. 3mm, and in the top to up to 7mm Break up the contents inside the egg with needle or skewer. Hold the egg over a bowl, place your mouth firmly round the middle of the egg forming a good seal over the top hole. Blow the contents of the egg out into the bowl. The yolk and whites will be ready mixed, perfect for scrambled eggs, omelettes or cakes.Put the crushed ice in a bowl and cover it with a clean tea towel.Use the flour and water paste to cover the bottom hole in all of the eggs.Stand your eggs upright in the ice. Pour a few tablespoons of one of your cream mixtures into the eggs using a small funnel or a piping nozzle. Allow this layer to set for around 10-15 minutes on the ice, and then add a few tablespoons of the other cream mixtureKeep building up the layers of cream until the whole egg has been filled.Once your eggs have set firmly, you can begin to remove the shells. One of the easiest ways to do this is by sliding a teaspoon between the shell and the set cream. It’s useful to keep a small bowl of cold water and a cloth ready to wipe your fingers between eggs so as not to smudge colours.Serve your eggs in a bowl, or in egg cups. For an extra Victorian flourish you could make a sponge cake ring and place the eggs inside, just like Mrs Crocombe.SUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL: https://goo.gl/c5lVBJ FIND A PLACE TO VISIT: https://goo.gl/86w2F6 VISIT OUR BLOG: https://goo.gl/DumtLo LIKE US ON FACEBOOK: https://goo.gl/Un5F2X FOLLOW US ON TWITTER: https://goo.gl/p1EoGh FOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM: https://goo.gl/PFzmY5"
How to Make Breakfast - The Victorian Way,"Feb 27, 2018",47526,1048,1129052,"Mrs Crocombe is busy making breakfast for Lord and Lady Braybrooke in the kitchens of Audley End House and Gardens. This recipe is perfect for using up leftover fish and rice. It originated in India as khichri, a dish made using lentils, rice, onions and spices. As the ‘jewel in the crown’ of the British Empire, the culture of the subcontinent influenced language, fashion and food in England in the 19th century. But Indian ingredients and techniques were difficult to come by in England, so dishes were adapted to suit English tastes and ingredients. Khichri became kedgeree.INGREDIENTS 200g cooked rice200g unsmoked fish50g unsalted butter½-1 tsp cayenne pepper1 tsp coarse grain salt2 eggsOptional:A little creamPickled or hard-boiled quail’s eggsParsley and Brown shrimp for garnishingMETHODPoach your fish in a mixture of half water and half milk. You’ll know that the fish is ready when the flesh becomes opaque - around seven minutes depending on the type of fish you’ve used.Break up the poached fish into large flakes with a fork Lightly whisk your eggs and prepare your garnishes. Slice the hard boiled quail’s eggs in half, and finely chop the parsley.Heat the butter in a frying pan on a medium heat until it foams and just starts to brown. Add the rice and stir well to coat it in butter. Fry it over a high heat to ensure it is piping hot throughoutTurn the heat down slightly and add the flaked fish, salt and cayenne pepper. Stir more gently now, turning the fish so that it does not break up too much.When everything is heated thoroughly, turn the temperature right down, and add the egg mixture. Turn very gently, just enough to mix the eggs in, and before they are solid, remove the pan from the heat. The eggs should still be slightly runny, as they would be on a good omelette.Stir in the cream to stop the kedgeree overcooking, then transfer onto a serving dish.Garnish the kedgeree. Arrange the quail’s egg halves around the dish and add the chopped parsley for a touch of colour. Serve immediately, while the kedgeree is still hot.Discover more Victorian recipes: https://goo.gl/o7quMQSUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL: https://goo.gl/c5lVBJ FIND A PLACE TO VISIT: https://goo.gl/86w2F6 VISIT OUR BLOG: https://goo.gl/DumtLo LIKE US ON FACEBOOK: https://goo.gl/Un5F2X FOLLOW US ON TWITTER: https://goo.gl/p1EoGh FOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM: https://goo.gl/PFzmY5"

Whilst the cucumber is still warm, pound it to soften it a little, then add the green food colouring. You can then add the brandy and lemon juice. The brandy is optional. Sieve the mixture to remove any lumps, then add the sweetened cream. Place some ice into a large bowl, then cover the ice in salt. You can then place a smaller bowl on top, and add the cucumber mix inside. Keep stirring the mixture, turning the bowl at the same time. Keep this going until your ice cream mixture has thickened. You can then add your thick mixture to some moulds, or an ice cream tub and place it in the freezer. After a few hours your ice cream will be ready.

How to Make A Christmas Cake - The Victorian Way,"Nov 30, 2017",76371,1389,7611864,"Christmas is approaching so Mrs Crocombe is making a cake for Lord and Lady Braybrooke at Audley End House. This traditional plum cake is based on a recipe by Charles Francatelli, who was Queen Victoria's chief cook from 1840 to 1841. INGREDIENTS680g plain flour680g butter450g caster sugar450g dried chopped cherries 680g currants 680g candied peel 225g ground almonds8 eggsZest of four oranges15g ground spices (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg) ½ pint of brandyFor the almond paste:225g ground almonds450g caster sugarA little orange water3-4 egg whitesFor the icing:6 egg whites680g icing sugarLemon JuiceMETHODPreheat your oven to 160ºC, 320ºF or gas mark 3.Line a large cake tin with butter and greaseproof paper.Soften your butter, then combine with the sugar, flour and eggs gradually. Then incorporate the cherries, currants, candied peel, ground almonds, spices and brandy until you have a thick mixture.Pour this mix into your lined cake tin, then place in a preheated oven and bake until a skewer comes out clean when placed into the centre of the cake. This will take around six hours, but keep an eye on it.Once your cake is out of the oven, remove it from the tin and leave it to cool on a wire rack. You can then make the almond paste. Mix the ground almonds, caster sugar and orange water together in a bowl. Slowly add in the egg whites, and mix until the mixture comes together into a dough. You may not need to use all of the egg whites, so keep an eye on the consistency of the mixture so it doesn’t become too thin. Take your almond paste and roll it out until it is around 5mm thick. Using your cake tin as a guide, cut out a circle to cover the top of the cake, and a strip to encircle the sides. You can then place it over the cake, using jam or water as a glue if necessary. Next you can make the icing by mixing the egg whites and fine sugar together. Add a few drops of lemon juice until the mixture becomes spreadable. Cover the cake in this icing mixture and leave this in a dry place until it turns hard. You can then decorate the cake by piping on some more icing. It’s up to you to choose your decorating style, but if you’d like to keep it authentically Victorian we suggest writing a Christmas message onto your cake. You can add a little food colouring to your icing to create an array of colours for your cake.

Brown it on medium high until it's the color brown. Add in:1 teaspoon of salt1 tablespoon chilli powder1 tablespoon cuminMix that all up and add in some water if it's really dry which it probably is Add in 3 cups of basil tomato sauce or whatever tomato sauce Cook that all together until it's hot and somewhat thick Take a container of ricotta cheese (15oz/475ml) and shred in a clove of garlic and wangjangle tf out of that then add in a cup and a half of shredded mozzarella and also wandjangle tf out of thatTake an 8 inch baking dish and put a thin layer of sauce on the bottom Oh don't forget to preheat that undoh on three seventy fundoAdd in a layer of sauce Add a layer of expertly cracked noodles Add in a layer of sauceA layer of ricotta with two smug spoons Then more noodles, sauce, ricotta, (once or twice more depending on the thickness of your ingredient distribution and your feelings on noodles) Then add a thick layer of mozzarella on top. More than I did. Or use parmesan like a lot of people do. By the way I was totally kidding when I said you could season the beef in the boring way with an onion. Lasagna has a very rich history and classic lasagna is very delicious, although I bet you could get a lot of people fighting over what classic lasagna is, exactly. I just didn't feel like dicing an onion when someone had already diced the chilli powder and cumin for me. Oh right, cook it for 30 to 40 minutes ish. After you put that foil on top. Then take off that foil and cook it for another ten a bit higher if you want to really melt and/or slightly brown that cheese. Let me know what I forgot or what I wrote wrong here and then I'll fix it later maybe."

Green Beer (You Suck at Cooking) Episode 87,"Mar 17, 2019",39663,329,4104697,"The history of Ireland is a long and storied one, and one I know next to nothing about. The history of St. Patrick is a short one, relative to the length of the history of the world. The current St. Patrick's day celebrating has little or nothing to do with the actual St. Patrick, and that's the way we like it. http://instagram.com/yousuckatcookinghttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookinThe first step to making green beer is to add a few drops of food coloring, then add beer. When selecting a glass to drink it out of, make sure it's transparent, that way you are able to see the green part of the beer not only from the top or from within the stomach, but also from the side while drinking beer. While pouring the beer, making sure not to pour it from a great height. This will decrease the amount of bubbles that end up in the beer when you are drinking it, and therefor the the enjoyment. If you were aware of the lengths that the manufacturers went to in order to get bubbles inside of that beer in the first place, you wouldn't even drink it at all. While drinking the beer,  make sure you don't allow the beer to come into contact with anything that could get stained, such as your clothes, dog, or mouth. If you swallow quickly enough you can keep your mouth from turning green permanently. If you dislike drinking beverages that are colored green but want to get into the festive spirit, simply tape green construction paper around your drinking vessel, and dye your beer purple instead."

In 1971, Nissin introduced Cup Noodles, the first cup noodle product. Instant noodles are marketed worldwide under many brand names.Ramen, a Japanese noodle soup, is sometimes used as a descriptor for instant noodle flavors by some Japanese instant noodle manufacturers. It has become synonymous in America for all instant noodle products.[2]”If you've never had actual ramen from a Japanese restaurant, put that at the top of your food-related to do list. Actually go right now. I don’t care if you’re at work, just go. Recipes: Checking for WABS is mostly necessary with the cheap North American packets (as far as I know). If you get Asian versions of instant ramen there are a LOT of great ones with tons of flavor, sauces, dehydrated vegetables. Also the ones served in cup seems to be more deluxe. Recipe #1: Broth of choice, Scallions and eggs. I tend to cook my egg most of the way through but you do you, boo. Recipe #2: Veggie or chicken broth, Scallions, peanut butter, chopped broccoli. This is my favorite. A simpler version of my spicy peanut butter soup video. Recipe #3: No broth, Bacon, butter, parmesan. For when you're feeling filthy and want to compound it. Recipe #4: Veggie or chicken broth, Indian curry paste and chic peas. There are a lot of veggies that would work well in this. There are also a ton of Indian curry pastes but I haven't met one I didn't like. Recipe #5 Beef broth, spinach, sliced steak. Slice the steak as thinly as possible. I was looking for flank steak, ended up using top sirloin, you could also use hanger steak or skirt steak...there is a lot of opinions on steak cuts but I'm already out of my comfort zone. Just in life in general.If you've read this far, congratulations, I'm giving away a prize to the few that get this far. The prize is the gift of reading my random ramblings for the next couple of minutes. Do you ever find yourself sitting around, living life, then suddenly you’re all WTF? I mean W IN T ACTUAL F. In an existential kind of way. Honestly the weight of actually existing, even when things are going great, is sometimes just super overwhelming. I'm not sure it's really fathomable. I mean if we think about the beginning of the universe and try to imagine the nothing that it came from, it's gotta be a trick. Like there can't have ever been nothing. But if there can't have ever been nothing then…this is the point at which I've actually gone mad. Help.  My brain is trying to stretch in a way it wasn't built for. My brain isn't Simone Biles, you know? And you shouldn't expect it to be. It has limits. But is that just the ceiling of my own confidence? The real problem here is that I said you won a prize, and usually prizes are supposed to be something good where you feel, ""yeah, I totally just won a prize, man, I love prizes.” But just look at this.  I'm not even sorry. It's possible I was up late last night."
