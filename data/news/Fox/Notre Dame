Quick to declare it an accident right before EASTER.
Tragically, a burned out and destroyed Notre Dame is a perfect metaphor for the France of today. The nation has lost its culture, history, and identity all in the name of open borders and political correctness. Now both France and Notre Dame are just husks of their former selves.
01:41 'It is not believed to be arson or terror related'. They must have some amazing forensic investigators in France.
This is obvious arson
Don't worry they'll build a nice mosque in place of it.
This is the hand of God almighty. I watched the pope last week refuse to let parishioners kiss his ring because he was afraid of germs. Later in the same week, he kisses the feet of two African Warlords. WORST Pope EVER.
waiting on MSM to blame this on Trump
I'm not Catholic but as a Christian I'm stunned and stand in prayers!  How absolutely horrible. Praying for you Paris from the United States!
Anti catholic hate is written all over this.
This is the 10th church set on fire in two months in France. I doubt it was an accident.
4th church in France this year damaged, no coincidence
2 hours for the fire trucks to get on the island??
I doubt we’ll get the truth on this either.
I am not a catholic, but notre dam to me was a true historical work of art. A building and contents that can never be replaced. Soo sad. And a real loss. To rebuild it just wont be the same.
I feel like this is just the beginning of many terrible events to follow
People of France, reclaim your culture and heritage!
No idea what went on? 875 Churches in one yr? ask some real questions. France is a joke and everyone can see what a disgrace the globalist agenda is!!!
This was a diversion by the government to turn people's attention away from the Yellow Vest Protesters.
Why do I feel like this isn’t an accident. I honestly feel like someone could’ve done this. Not blaming anyone, just saying this might not have been an accident.
"...when Paris burns The End will begin." Marie Julie Jahenny
it took 2 hrs for the fire trucks to arrive...?   hmm.
Construction started in 1163, and ended in 1345... to be destroyed in 2019.
Notre Dame was a casualty of tolerance.
“The entire roof is fully destroyed,” Picaud said. “The fire started up near the roof top while another fire started in the north bell tower.

The fire was started in 2 places.
1 John 2:15-17


Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them. For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world. The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever.
Is it a coincidence this fire occurred during Christianity's Holiest Week?


☪ someone ☪ is trying to send a message
I don't care what anybody say, that fire was set.
This day will go down in history …
Considering that on average, in France alone, 2 churches a day (!) burn down (by arson) I find it a bit premature to assume this was not arson.
It is time for Charlemagne and Joan of Arc to return to France.
Very suspicious  on holy week ,for all Christian's.  France ,once a major influence in the world  will downplay any wrongdoing . Blessings  to the French people On your loss ,and the worlds loss .    Vive  France !
So many more people than just those who are religious will mourn the loss of this incredibly beautiful and loved cathedral
It wasn’t an accident from the renovation, when you do any kind of work that might start a fire in a place like that you would need a permit, it was most likely terrorism, I wounded if anybody is taking credit for it
This just breaks my heart, especially hearing about the stained glass windows blowing out.  What an enormous loss.
The accident started with a prayer rug soaked in kerosene and a book of matches.
took them less than 24 hours to announce it was an accident.   maybe they are correct but it seems a deeper investigation is necessary.
Where will The Hunchback go now? So sad.
I guess you could say the cathedral was LIT AF
"Hey Caputzo do you even capuccino the meaning of this at all goddam smack head !"
Seems they are burning churches these days. 3 African American  churches  just burnt down  in Atlanta earlier this month.  On a roll aren't they
Don't kid yourself this was no accident ! 
Conveniently one week before Easter !
I heard somebody being interviewed on BBC he said it was a relic of the past and people who don't have that Faith anymore --- read between the lines
so, it's still smoldering, nigh time, and no investigation has been completed.....and you already know it was an accident??
"Repent, the kingdom of heaven is at hand"...
hopfully the building will be ok and the people fighting the fire.😔
I'm half French and fully devastated.. I was at work when I heard the news.. Can only cry for what we are losing  as I write this.. Terrible..
if this was arson, we will NEVER know...the French government will make sure of that.
How could this have happened...no fire suppression, no security, this is unbelievable. Someone needs to account for this unnecessary catastrophe. There should have been many more precautions taken.
A tragedy in religion and in history
See channel "the outer light" mystery figure on Notre Dame rooftop before fire. Dated 4/18/19
Whatever that can be saved should be the priority. History is something valuable that should be preserved
Sickening.. been standing since the 12th century
Well there goes my +10 happiness and +4 faith
What the hell is happening in this world? Tragedies are becoming common almost every 2-3 days, or even weeks.
GOD has Left the Building .. Will He Return is Up to You
Funny how come 4 days before this so call accident, things were removed from the top of the cathedral. How come it took 2 hours for the fire fighters to get there. How come they did not use the water right there on hand. This is very suspicious
The cross stands a tall an amazing picture out of the Ashes we are reborn to continue our fight our struggle
Perhaps now is the time in the midst of this tragedy, that we must remember more than ever, Notre Dame is not burning. Notre Dame is not the Cathedral, but the people who come together to worship there. We are the Church, God-Made creatures, where the Lord dwells, not man made structures to His glory.
My girlfriend and I are travelling to Paris in July. I really really wanted to see the Notre Dame Cathedral. I am just saddened and heartbroken. Prayers to all the people of Paris who lost one of their natural treasures.
"I'll find her.  I'll find her if I have to burn down all of Paris!"  - Frollo.
We all know whose fault this is.
No sprinkler system?
Well, as sad as it is, there's a lesson in all this, appreciate what you got today cause some day that shits gonna be gone lol. Maybe its the right year to visit that ancient thing you've been wanting to see for ages ;)
This had 2 of my favorite things, fire and old buildings, sadly here they are together, gonna miss it
2 hours for firetrucks to arrive?  Wow!  Notre Dame survived wars but not a renovation.  What a shame, hope they rebuild this beautiful structure.
How the hell do you accidentally start a fire
So they were trying to restore it, and instead set it on fire? Makes sense.
what.is.happening.
This is horrible! I hope that it gets reconstructed.
Did the Hunchback survive, any news?
Sad day for all Catholics.... Sad sad day indeed.
Ocasio-Cortez said its climate change
Either this is the result of complete ineptitude or deliberate action.  Either way this is scary, unacceptable and people need to be held accountable.
This is sad ,weird how the last few years a lot of churches have had ACCIDENTS that burn them down,but im glad to see the puppet makes sure we know it was not arson ,in the EU all fires in all churches are never arson ,i think they need better fire alarms in all Christian buildings just to be safe,must not have these nasty accidents  where the public can see them.
it's a secret attack on france soul
It seems to be a poor firefighter's operation letting the masterpiece cathedral burned to the ground incomprehensible out of control???
OMG how sad, such a national treasure
Two hours later did they show up? 
No emergency helicopters in Paris? 
Really?
Rip the hunchback 




But this is actually really sad shouldn’t be making jokes but it was so easy😐.
Catholic church old as time burns. Wonder if it has to do with a certain influx of migrants in France?
I hope the hunchback of Notre Dame is alright
Are we all thinking the same thing or are we going to act dumb. Fires don't just start.
I told them not to play my mixtape in there
Comments about firing Shep are being deleted.
It survived WWI, WWII only to be lost when a worker tosses a lit cigarette butt into a pail of oily rags.
For we shall be hated for his name. Thank you Lord you are the only Saviour for one day all shall bow down every tongue every knee and confess that you Jesus Christ Our Lord God above all Alpha and Omega! Praise God hallelujah and forgive them for they know not what they say they do or see I declare discernment upon everyone and everything in Jesus name amen!
" It is not believe to be terrorism ". And no incendiary devices were used in WACO .
Chill dudes... There's Notre Dame thing we can do about it now eh?

I'll walk myself out....to hell
Every architecture student and architect has studied this building. I hope (I am pretty sure) that this building is documented sufficiently so it can be reconstructed. Can we start a GO FUND Me page?
i like how people still talk about trump in something not even related to him
I'm glad I got it to see it in 1996. Everything in there was older than my great great grandmother.
4 months ago I went to see the cathedral, now it’s collapsing..
I was with my mom and when we received the news, and we overhead a little boy ask his grandmother if Quasimodo was still in the cathedral, and if he would still be okay. My heart broke. This is so sad, all the history, and beauty that will be gone
Hopefully they can save this beautiful cathedral.
My heart is broken into pieces :(
I’m beyond blessed to have had the opportunity to see this ancient masterpiece of a build before it was permanently changed today ❤️❤️❤️
Cant wait for the Jason A video
I took for granted every time I visited this church in Assasin Creed Unity
Another work of art destroyed by careless people.
Time for a rebuild
The symbolism is disheartening  and frightening especially  as it relates to current events in the Western world.  Alarming indeed !!!
I hope quasimodo made it out safely
"For the time has come for judgment begin at the house of God and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God" (1Peter 4:17; cp Ezekiel 9:6).
The Full Armor of God
10Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. 11Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 12For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 13Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God. 

Ephesians 6
I am a Thai person. Please express my condolences for this.🙏🙏🙏
FOX NEWS IS NOW THE NEW CNN
2 hrs to arrived .? Wow France is worse than what I though.
Wow those circular front windows with the smoke coming out looked like a freaking Skull
This is a symbol for the state of Europe
Well never know with any degree of certainty what caused the fire.
1000 of years of history destroyed 
Sad.....  I think it’s arson 
It’s a church and terrorism has happened before in Paris 
I don’t really know tell me what u think
Honestly if they did update it and included electricity then it could of just been an electrical fire bc those spread very quickly especially in older buildings
What a terrible tragedy. I hope most of the building and its art works could be saved
Ww2 flashbacks are happening the rise  seekens
Ninja deployed C4 when no one was looking, you can see in his Europe vlog lmao.
I find it hard to believe that a group of professionals would screw up that bad.
I'm waiting to see what's unearthed, what secrets this building is hiding....
Heartbreaking loss of priceless art and architecture !
im pretty sure most major world events are planned.
Frollo..what did you do, God dammit...
My heart goes out to the church, the relics, the artifacts inside, and all the people whom built and maintained it.
The Cathedral is gutted
I study medieval architecture. That took all the people of Paris 350years or more to build. My dames is unbelievable. The wonder of the Christian world in ruins.800year antique masterpieces of art..gone...sad.
ninja did WHAT in Europe?
was God cleansing the temple ??
This is so devastating having such a historic monument probably taking decades to build just burn down in moments
Burning for how long?
😢 prayers for paris🙏🏻❤.
I love when tragedy strikes!!!
Please pray 🙏❤️
has terrorism been ruled out?
God bless humanity.
They made no effort to save it?!?
some dude probably was like no one would notice.  2 minutes later donald trump is talking about it
Terrible. It's really unfortunate, but luckily the outside is still standing. I really hope nobody was hurt when it fell. Also-- why does nobody know what the Notre Dame Cathedral is?
One prayer from united States Los Angeles California! I feel so sad right now why this have to happen to this beautiful build of are history especially for my Catholic my faith my Catholic brothers and sisters it's so hard and so sad that this symbol of history and religious is burning I feel like crying right now.
I guess they got my mix tape?
Imagine the money that could be gained from the insurance on a building like that...
I bet in 5 years a mosque is built there.
...it's  "God's Will"
There has been a focused attack on churches throughout France for the past 2 weekss, but of course the media REFUSES to report on that. MALIBU SNACKBAR!
The apocalypse is near stock up ON AMMO
"Ryan started the fire!"
How did they let this happen!?
You just can't trust the French with nice things... pity.
Of course, they quickly say that terrorism likely is not the cause.  Don't try to connect dots, folks.
riley j dennis did it
Your heart just aches watching the fire.
quasimodo predicted all this
amazing how a stone Castle Cathedral can survive for 800 years and then all the sudden get destroyed buy Accidental Fire, wake up people,
Oh noooo is the hunchback okayyyy
This is so sad 😩
Jesus is king. Keep your eyes on he and he alone.
Where's the Nostradamus prophesies of this? Hahaha
Our story goes into smoke
With that "leadership" it won't be long until the rest of France burns
Fortunately only the roof was touched not the front of the building
5 bucks says they pin this on the French riots.
France strong 💪 The most important thing is that there are no human casualties. The church will rebuild and it would be beauty and stronger. Support for the French from the Serbia.
How did catch on fire? There no way easy get on flame
Let MORE mosselims in!
Did Quasimodo get out alright
2 hours for firetrucks?  Huh??
Tourist should have used their brain and move away so the fire fighters could have contained the fire but their stupidity is enormous and because of it this beautiful gothic antic is very very damaged. I am not catholic but it hurts to see the beauty of Notradame burning down :(
Hail Emperor Nero sry Macron.
I loved it a lot😭
This is definitely arson.
Ninja, I’ll find you
I was the 4000th like lol
It's crazy how just last summer , I was there and took pictures of everything in the inside. Now,  everything is gone😔 I'm so blessed I got the chance to see this beauty 💘 Stay strong Paris !
So sad to lose such a historical treasure.
So sad to hear this.
Deliberate act period!!  It was crumbling!  Insurance or should I say millionaire job
There were 12 attacks in churches at France by anti Christian movements since March. Suddenly this near 900 year old church is burned down. Coincidence?
My heart is absolutely broken. I was lucky enough to visit Notre Dame and when I enter the cathedral the organ was playing. It was absolutely beautiful and gives me chills to this day.
Is the hunch back ok?
how did it catch fire?
oh my God!
Microwave 'voice to brain' technology activates susceptible individuals worldwide to shoot others (Colorado) or burn down churches. (France) (NYC-St Pats)
As a person who loves history this is sad to see I’m just happy that they are gonna be able to rebuild it won’t be like it was but better then it not being at all
But is Quasimodo ok?
He said burning to the ground
Very sorry for the loss of Notre Dame. It can be rebuilt if people have the desire to rebuild it. This has been done many times with other historical buildings. I hope it brings people around the world together.
How? How could this fire just appear?
This is terrible what happened in New Zealand 🇳🇿 now France 🇫🇷
Thankfully most of the structure is still standing. I might take 20 years to repair, instead of the 100 it would take to rebuilt it from scratch.
Warmest thoughts to the people of France-
Took over 200years to build, took few hours to burn down.
My girlfriend messaged me about this on my way home from work and I thought she was talking about college football.
But........ Heres what you Dont Hear Them Saying.... What caused it to "Engulf in Flames" Think Real Hard.... I Say its... "What were They Doing that went bad and.... Exploded....?
Well this is the definition of Hellfire from Frollo
Frollo did it
Very sad. I can only Imagine all the history that was lost
Titanic happened same day over 100 years ago, Im illiterate with numbers so someone work it out
It can be rebuilt but will not have that historic feeling no more.
MY FRIEND IS IN PARIS AND SHE WONT ANSWER MY CALLS OR TEXTS
700 years of basically at this point nothing
It's all got to end sometime!!
It withstood wars and occupation, but not an ordinary pack of Winstons. Irony indeed. It will be fun if it turned out to be a pack of Winstons.
So no Assassins Creed unity 2
Now I know the firefighters didn’t care they could’ve called Natau to eat the fire freaking pieces of crap it’s the firefighters fault
C'EST LA GARRE,NON???
An epic and historic loss. Another French monumental structure will surely rise up from the ashes, demonstrating French resolve, once again.  Je suis un American, mais tres malade.
2 hours for the fire trucks arrive ...way to go France?   Can France do anything right besides make wine?
God is angry. Take heed.
Oh my god. I hope nobody is hurt. This is a cultural tragedy for not only Christians, but for history itself.
I Was about to go to pairs😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪
The Sand Peepol  did this.
Though I am not Catholic, and I am not French, I am glad I did visit this place during my Army days.
send your thoughts and prayers , hold your cash just the way the church does
I wonder if someone started it on purpose and you know what kind of people that would do this. This is as sad as it gets.
GOD HAS LEFT THE CHAT
Good morning， Francestan !
Oh that can't be good
I hope the saved the hunchback dude
Looks arsonist got to it before God did
It's done spire and roof all caved in.
This fire was set by a person. No accident. No way an accident!
YOU MONSTROUS BEASTS!
thats sad...my prayers are going out today for the people who have in one way or another be touched by this beautiful building...the true meaning will of what it stood for will always be in your hearts..Blessings of Love from Above....praying for all involved to be safe as they deal with this tragedy....🙌
If you have to MAKE UP A STORY,"YOUR LYING." The 11th CRUSADE has BEGUN,GOAT LOVERS😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😭
I hope they can save whatever they can. They will definitely rebuild it but it will take a while. D:
Can you imagine being one of the guys who was doing the work that started the fire?
Was this an accident or an act of terror? It's very suspicious right before easter.
It took two hours for them to respond? People are getting fired that's for  sure. No pun intended
Where is god? LOL
I watch spungbob
It is a Globalist agenda to distract from the strenght of the Yellow Vest Movement in France.  Think about it, why is this getting more media coverage?
It really is a tragedy that such a beautiful building has met such a tragic fate
NOT THE CATHEDRAL!!!!!!! Wait wtf is a cathedral
This is God's judgement on Macron.
The loss of world civilization, it’s okay, people are fine.
I'm not suggesting it...but if that fire was deliberate, France will explode.
What is wrong with people to stand there watching something burn like and block they way of the firefighters trying to go put it out?
Prophecies fulfilling
We lost our forfather heritage...
Oh god 😭
Very very sad to see this
The Obamas were seen there today giving confession. 😳
Is it a sign, downfall.
Frollo: "Esmeraldaaaaaaaaa"
This ain’t lit fam...
Nobody was injured ? That’s the most important thing that counts
"It took fire engines two hours to arrive"?  WTF?
"Historical" contents
Let the frollo memes begin.
It was ninja
"It took firetrucks 2h to arrive?" Where did they get that information?
This is not a good sign!
My condolences to every French and every Catholic Christians in the world!A great loss indeed for the people of the Book!
One month, TO THE DAY, after ChristChurch.
Sums up france
Build it back!!!
Ummmm who started it?? I have a sad hunch
Steve Bannon did it.
Saddens the heart.. loved going to the Gregorian chants on Sunday mornings during my stay in Paris. Had the most epic stain glass window, like an enormous jewel.
Sad day in history
No fire system in such an important place? Ahh Frenchies...
The spire...
Such a shame. 700 years of history up in smoke. I hope it will be repaired quickly, but it will never be the same. All of Christendom is saddened by the loss of this treasure of western civilization.
SSSSS I just saw this on the news omg😱
If only this was London Bridge
Thnx ninja rip Paris
There should’ve been modern fire sprinklers installed years ago. Lack of foresight
Our top priority now is to put France flag filter on our profile picks. Scientifically most effective counter to terrorism.
Where is my boy Quasimodo gonna live? His house is not livable.
Protestants did it.
Holy crap...
850 yyes of
My heart breaks for France, Paris, the Catholics and the Parisians!  800 years old, withstood the napoleonic wars, two world wars  and several city sackings and then to be taken out during a renovation!!!!  Unbelievable.  I did work on Mount Vernon and we had to have a fire extinguisher with us at all times, hell we couldn't lite a cigarette  within 500' of the structure and needed a burn permit to do any work that even had the smallest chance of an open flame?  Just don't see how this could happen?  no sprinkler system?  and lets not even talk about the time it took for the fire dept to arrive!  yeah i know it is not the US im just very upset to lose such an icon of western culture. One btw we will never get to see again in our lifetime!
I hope Quasimodo is ok.
nuuuuuuuu the important monument D:
GOD. IS. PISSED.
pay your debits or get real insurance I recommend loyds of London
You think this calms down the demonstration?
This is devastating
Sad you can't save them！(´•ω•`)
This is just devastating. Why would someone do this? And just before Easter
So is the Gekyumes Circumcision canceled?
Mate they needed Helicopters not fire engines
Guess I ain't going to paris
OMG I went inside it last year :( so sad it was a beautiful monument
Omg hopefully no one died or got hurt
god bless
That's terrible how a piece of history has burnt down I'm curious how did it happend
Why the fire still burn it so long time.
Rest In Piece a legendary structure. Support from the Philippines 🇵🇭
Nothing to see here.
I was lucky enough to be able to go there a few years ago
Al Kaida Turkey did it
“We don’t know what caused the fire but we’re certain is is NOT terrorism.”  Hmmm sounds like a huge contradiction here.
I’m not religious but this is especially sad since it took nearly 200 years to create
It is not only a loss to those of the Catholic faith, but a loss to all of western civilization.
Went there last year hope everyone is safe
It was started by an illegal imagrant trying to open a cocanut with a blow torch.
Suspicious.
The fact that I learned so much about Notre Dame just this year in French class breaks my heart even more.
When I read the name Notre dame my mouth jaw just unhinged
Its the beginning
Helicopters with water bags and the river right there would of got this fire out much faster
The rapture is coming.
Good serves them right for nuke tests in Polynesia paradise
I'm so happy. I'm going to drink a lot of wine in front of the pictures of Yuanmingyuan tonight
They sure allowed that thing to burn long enough. Looks like it played into someone’s favor to erase part of French and European history like that
Ik this is random but I just thought of something, one if there’s a group of anti history people that have a goal of burning down historic monuments, idk I think I’m on to something...the Roman Colosseum may be next
This is the start of religion being dragged down by the government. Jesus is coming sooner than you think. One by one they will try to deceive and not allow you to believe and see the truth
Makes one wonder if Some People were doing the renovations??
The whole dame thing is burning
So sad 😭
$7 million restoration? Is it just me who thinks that's a little cheap, for such a historical building?
We are living in strange times.
Did he say the president druph?
I swear did the narrator say drumph?
He's live...IN LONDON?!?!?!?
There it goes. God left us long ago
You neglected to mention Macron's original comments that hinted at a mosque being built on the site. Those comments have been removed from the Internet and replaced with a a more general comment about the rebuilding. Notre Dame is an icon of French Catholicism. France will not allow its Ritchie puppet macron to bow to the caliphate he seems so hell bent on allowing to take over France.
What a moment to be alive.
MACRON  has  Stabbed  France  in  the  HEART 
How  Convenient  MACRON......
The  Burning  down  of  Notre Dame Cathedral.
Its   called   a  DIVERSION........
WOE  to  those  who  Harm GOD's Children.
GOD  Will  NOT  be  Mocked.
This is bloody awful 😔💔
Nooooo i planed to visit the cathedral when i turned 18
By all accounts enough money has been donated already to sort out the work for restoration! I think it should be restored to the original design, not the design just before the fire.
Hopefully fast finish
JOANES PAULI 2.FRANCJO NAJSTARSZA córko KOŚCIOŁA ,co zrobiłaś ze swoim CHRZTEM.WSTAŃ I PODMIEŚ SIE Z KOLAN ,TERAZ ALBO NIGDY!!!VIVA LA FRANCE -VIVA LA POLOGNE!!!!!!!
Jesus h christ everyone in the comments are just being rude asses.  I'm just really upset that such a beautiful and historic building is being destroyed. Tragedy, it was so beautiful
SANCTUARY!!! SANCTUARY!!!SANCTUARY!!! SANCTUARY!!!
Cersei has taken it too far this time
...
Oh my god...I had really wanted to see this too..😰 it's gone now.
it is true if its such an important landmark why not have some kind of fire protection in place as standard? its on the river???? water!!! its all a bit strange too me
Paris-
             America is praying for you..
Sheep herder Smiith needs to go!
Varg strikes again
Jesus lives.
Where's ladybug and Catnoir when you need them?
Hmmm. A cathedral that's 800 years old gets burned down during holy week after refugees flood into the country. I don't think that's a coincidence. They have to hide the truth of this, or people will flip out.
😢 that’s tuff
The building was made 1000 yours ago and if they rebuild it it won’t be the same it will just be a new church
This is terrible :( So much of France's culture was symbolized within Notre Dame :( :( The glorious religion that is celebrated is what made that building majestic...oh my god :(
The end times are upon us
I cry
Remember the Library of Alexandria? Nothing is what it seems....  This is a 'check mate' in some grand chess game.
They'll probably put a mosque in it's place.
So sad...the hx the art work such anicionic treasure
Look up I pet goat 2 it predicted this in 2012
Shoulda covered the yellow vest
What caused this?
I’d be willing to be it was a “refugee” to set fire to it
We are very happy to see this fire accident  😀 Voices from China
Actually it took 10 minutes for firefighters to arrive on Notre Dame, they fought inside and outside the cathedral.
perhaps fox news could become a collection point for donations towards the restoration of notre dame.
Like FIRE! Hellfire! This fire in my skin!
That's what you get for not finishing your Spanish lesson
How can the media say arson is ruled out as a cause of the fire before the church even stops burning!? That's not normal lol
Over the past year many churches in France have been attacked. This is no accident. This also is the start of Holy week. French authorities no nothing how this started yet they claim it was not arson or terror related.  What a tragic day being there once myself. 2 HOURS to get the fire dept. there????
The 3rd church since March
What a shame. I'm not Catholic but still heartbroken. All the history contained in that building gone. I wonder what caused the fire, and how they let it get so far out of control. You would think a very important place like that, they would have done more to stop it.
Psalms 9:17 Kjv🔱
Revelation 18:8 Kjv📚
🕎👍😇🕎👌😂🔯
Y'all going down Esau
and they want the same street systems and no movement of cars to be brought into NYC and it will also take NYFD 2 hours to get to a burning building in NYC because of ex mayor Bloomberg hate of cars and the same wit the new mayor today..
Noooo we did artwork from that in Ohio and that is sad
So sorry to hear about this, churches are such a safe haven for everyone and such a monument for 800 years.
This is so sad. Just so sad.
Fire burns the Cathedral and the current Pope burns the Church.
Put it on the history books
looks like the protestants finally got their ways
Another French church burnt to the ground... interesting.
Trump could get more information from his son of law, Jared Kushner!
This is in my wish list to visit next year. How sad.
Trump reading off Q card
This is a sign of the end times.
WHY !
There seems to be a lot of late arrivals for government services lately.
Hope the hunch back is ok
Tourists lol
oh my golly gosh i hope paris can recover
When I clicked on the TV and saw all that smoke rising from Notre Dame my first thought was...  What?  They picked a new pope?
Fox why did shep Smith ask a person who witnessed the fire his opinion and then quickly cut the guy off as he was answering the question? That is anything but journalism and is a prime example of why most people think all of mainstream media is a joke. Except Tucker.
O my god
Looks like someone forgot to rake up around there...lol
Did Quazimodo get out in time?  I haven't heard any word.
A loss for humanity.
Sad to see history go up in flames. I hope they can rebuild it. I cannot imagine the cost to recreate what was lost considering the craftsmanship and artistry it took to make it so long ago.
It didn't collapse at freefall speed?
Someone’s getting fired
So recent comments
Don’t worry, the replica can be real as possible
Was it terrorism?  I hope they don’t build a mosque there now?  My God
as a French Catholic, this hurts me on a personal level...
Guess god doesnt have enough power to protect the churches. they need more children
They wanted it gone
Macron can take this opportunity and replace it with a Mosque for his beloved followers
Who is involved
this is so sad rn now i’m in europe for vacation. right now i’m going to switzerland and tmr i’m going to paris
STOP trying to see that this was an accident. NO ONE KNOWS yet.
And from the globalists Macron and secularism that is now most of Paris and a lot of Europe...we may never know.
This was France’s inability to properly fight this fire...two hours to get to the scene & noway to get fire hoses to the roof unreal !!!! And I’m assuming no fire system or sprinklers inside ????
O great news.
I am Soo happy 🤣
Even if it was arson & the authorities knew it they would never tell the public, especially if it involved, let’s say, “non-Christians”?
Come on people, it wasn't arson, it was simply just a (((malfunction))) and an (((accident))). Everything else is a (((coincidence))), obviously
Ninja did it
Is that where Macrons new house will be?
The church is us. Not that building. Sad day but we stand strong.
Sprinkler system upgrade?
"It's burning very badly. Looks like it's burning to the ground"
That was so dull...
This is one of the reasons why we shouldn't let refugees into Europe.
It depresses me to see all ghis history burn to the ground. If there is anything that makes me mad is when I see history go down like this.
I wonder if they save the Sacred Torah.
Its just a building, chill out. Besides, God is just laying waste to 
Sodom and Gomorrah (The Catholic Church). It was a Monument to 
Pedophilia and Sodomy.
While Rome burned
APTTMH
At least they won the World Cup🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Whyyyy and howww?!
It is a tragedy.   Too bad neither the fire nor its rebuild will cause many people to repent.  Maybe some..but not all who see its fires will.  Fools see it as a cultural icon.  That is the problem with modern men.  All that knowledge and little wisdom. 

Where were the fire trucks,  where is fire suppression systems?  No wisdom. 

Were are the airplanes or boats to shoot water on it.  No wisdom. 

How does our daily sin set Christ on the cross.   No wisdom.
In the words of Usher "Let it Burn"! LMBO!
Check the locations of the Hot Work Permits...and the video cameras. It's either industrial or deliberate.
I don't live anywhere near France but i just feel sick to my stomach watching this.  People need to come together to help each other, we need to restore and rebuild not only this historic cathedral, but our faith in each other.
Ninja did it
It will be interesting to find out what started it. I can’t help but think that this was an act of arson.
If this doesn't start a new French revolution I don't know what will.
Well this is sad to hear and to see
PK Fire
Jacques De Molays curse is coming to mind. He was burned right outside Notre Dame.
I think God did it.
😢⛪💔
President DRUMP  0:35
Migrants did this
Play 4 Paris
Looks like somebody did something
It’s so sad.
Lmao reading the comments on any Notre dame video on any other channel is nothing like reading the fox news comments. The absolute state of you conspiratorially minded  bafoons
Christianity is under attack.
Donald Duck did it
Someone is getting fired, literally. If it wasn’t arson nor terrorism
Found out about this in a Minecraft server
This is some gta kind of stuff
In my school, the juniors and seniors are currently taking a huge field trip to first paris, then italy. I am so thankful that they are not in that area aymore, for they left one day before this happened. It is by the grace of God that they are kept safe.
Fire engines took 2 hours to arrive? The cathedral never stood a chance.
Shepard Smith cut off a witness of the fires telling their side of the story why because they want control the narrative.
some 'stoned' worker didn't flip the switch to off
There going to replace it with a Mosque 🕌
yo someone get the hunchback
Where is varg this week
Dont believe your ears,they perform as it is a show,they even smiling. But it's augury,you must know it. Good luck humanity
650 years... Survived the era of gaslamps and candlelight... What will survive the age of incompetence?
Isn't it strange that it almost looks like the statue of liberty that is burning?

The base of the spire and up.
Next thing you'll hear is that there's a mosque being built on the site.
Jacques de Molay’s revenge says...think I’m the old thing that you can burn.....wrong again. Quasi rules!
Anybody saw a DEW beforehand? One can only wonder
CNN: We now have experts telling us that this is the work of Trump or the Russians .....possibly.
Yesterday would’ve been the last mass at Norte Dame...
Thanks Macron, Very cool!
Funny with one of the hottest fires I have seen engulfing the staging made of relatively thin metal did not melt and collapse? But heavy steal girders did in another famous structure fire . I'll let you connect the dots .
Wow Trump always going with respect and measure announcing our cathedral "looks like it's burning to the ground" when only the roof was ablaze. Real nice Donald. Real sensitive, thank you 😒
Before you reconstruct Notre Dame Cathedral better get the mohammedans out from France, otherwise you may waste your money. Seems to me that your President Macron talking to you like to hay eaters. The man has no respect to the French people. Put the sick man down ASAP. UN & EU & France & Germany etc will try to cover up the truth.
Something: (happens)
News: MUST RECORD IT
900 years of Christian history gone,what a shame.
It was the mazis
It's like if I'm rebuilding someone's 54 Chevy truck cause their great granddad bought it new.And it burns to the floor.And get him another 54 Chevy.Its not the same.
let it burn
Hopefully it can be rebuilt and none were injured.  All they can do is to keep it from spreading. What was not destroyed by fire would be damaged by water.
So sad...😭😭😭
Hmm i seemed to have missed the part where the democrats blame trump🤔😂
That's sad😢😦
The Democrats will soon blame it on Trump .
I feel so bad that it got burned! It was so beautiful but now it got burned 😢
There are 11 churches are on fire during the past 3 moths. Religion war started already!
Thousands of Hindu temples were destroyed
I know the pain of losing holy places
Idiota  la única casa que trataron de destruir de la cristiandad fue el templo llamado Jesús
Looks like a place for a new Islamic Center just opened up in the heart of Paris...
Did he say "President Drump" @0:38??
I know she is ok she called
I wonder if the hunchback is okay.
Dont be too surprised if it turns out to be isis.
Sorry  a was  playing  I didn't  me  it  😭😔
Probably just the beginning after all  many Christian haters arrived in Europe lately.
drump?
Good thing no one was hurt or died during the fire incident which is the most important part. However, it is so devastating that such a magnificent work of art and part of Paris identity was burned into ashes. This is such a tragic moment that the world will remember all throughout history.
There has been 10 attacks on Christian Churches in France in the last month.
Coincidence?
Notre Dame Cathedral? What's that place? Can some one tell me?
So sad 😫😫😫
Meh. I feel nothing from this.
In my last trip to Paris , Paris was hit by floods. And now this. So sad.
french will cover it up......is-lame did it...
Always wanted to visit but now I don't think I ever will
Paris is suffering again with another tragedy. Hope is not done in purpose by those who hate Christianity. EASTER time 🤔🤔
Didn't I already see this in a Disney movie?
Represents the current state of France. Burning.
Someone's getting fired and its not just the building
Isn’t this building made of concrete? Or stone? Well, look at that fire! Hmmmmm???
Kind of symbolic how the Catholic Church has been in free fall collapse since Vatican II...and accelerating under the Argentine clown....real Catholics lost this building a long time ago - after the French Revolution....
The person who did this shall never be forgiven
Depressing to see it go, though I have large doubts of it not being arson/terror related considering what's been happening over there. Though we will see in the coming hours/days.
The roof, the roof....
Thank the Lord it didn't collapse
Punishment by you know who for the yellow vests.
Fire specialists are indicating that accelerants were used to create such a rabid fire.
anti christ agenda. there will be some revelations this year
nice, i hope the rest of the west follows suit
oh my gosh. this is unbelievable . . . wonder what's next? seriously though, this has got me really FIRED up. thats so sad though, i wonder if it's a accident or somebody was just being careless [as in human caused]
No matter whAt fake news says , this was an act of war and the French leader is to blame period
A tragic tragic site- So upset for the whole world and especially for the French people. 😢Just out of interest, How long before
 the fire crews got there? I feel like the containing of the fire with the fire heroes is also part of the story.
MY CHILDHOOD >:/!!! I HAVENT EVEN VISITED IT YET
There's an old poem by William Blake called the Tyger. Tyger, tyger burning bright, in the forests of the night....
So sad.
So sad.
I am filipino and the Notre Dame Cathedral is one of the many historical structures that I wanna visit someday. Seeing it burn to the ground is like watching one of my dreams fall apart. This is too tragic and depressing for me. 😯😭
Oh well
Anyone else thinking about the song hellfire?
I actually cried wtf it’s so sad because it had so much history and dimension to it😔I hope they can fix it
Uh oh... looks like "some people did something" again!
Prayers for Paris 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔😟😟😓😓😓
That’s sad 😢
Trump: "it looks like its burning to the ground"
Sounds like reichstag fire.
Shocked, thank God fire exinguished ,these buildings are heritage of whole mankind not only a particuler country
Why can't Fox News help but lie? The cathedral was not destroyed. It's still there, you can check.
Rebuild to remember or rebuild because you believe?
Do you know  that I do an current event on this!
How did it get set on fire?
I could see Quasimodo in the Bell Tower laughing...!!!
THE END IS NIGH I'm ready.
Outside objects will always burn or crumble but the word that inspires the religion will always be
In the middle of renovation
Do anyone in Paris heard of helicopters🤔🤔
Construction accident after hours...they will stick with that.
This is what happens when Europe is being overrun by trash and thugs
Some people did somethings
Too many coincidences. No accident.
Omg. That is terrible! I'm shook!
two thousand years of history that are collapsing, Lord have mercy!
If it's found out that a certain religion did this to this bastion of Christianity in France, and the government tries to cover it up it will be the last  straw in an already highly fractured country.
Satan burned it
Don't they have airdrop capability?   They probably could make good use 
of Canada's Martin Mars.   I don't understand why they don't do massive 
water drops.  Maybe they're worried about the ecological effects of all 
those hi octane gasoline engines on old airplane without smog controls.   Right!   For the French that makes perfect sense.  For the French version of EPA it probably is close to the truth.
A lot of people are talking about it like it’s just to do with religion but Norte Dame was a beautiful building with a lot of history. It is one of the most visited monuments of France and the heart of Paris it means a lot to french people in general and not just Catholic’s. It survived for 800 years but one accident was all it took. Just because it’s a religious building it doesn’t make the situation any less tragic.
2 Peter 3:10\   But the day of the Lord will come
 as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a
 great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth 
also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
Think about all the books and art in that beautiful building that is now ash... The building is a great structure but the items within are more precious imo. Sad to see it burning like that :( A piece of history was lost
Glad the firefighters were able to save part of the structure.  It takes some real skills to save an 800 year old structure and focus on what can be saved and what can't while everything is burning around you.
What a shame....while people are trying to promote world peace, others are doing this....I hope no one is severely injured and that at least some of the church is restored
Must have been Claude frollo
It won't be long until someone blames Trump.
It's ridiculous to think this was an accident!
That building is supposed to be made of solid Stone!!! Explain to me how in the hell Stones can catch on fire!!! That makes absolutely no sense at all!!! 
Go ahead and get a lighter or a match box and try to light stones on fire and tell me what happens!!! 
That fire-destruction is evidence that somebody made a HUGE mistake when they constructed that building!!! It was supposed to be made 'strictly' out of 100% pure solid Stone and absolutely nothing else!!!
Who benefits from this destruction?
Is god angry with what France let happen to itself.
Alguien que hable español y me explique  lo que esta pasando
Really trump have heart...
My parents visited Paris in 2014 and got to tour the cathedral. They were heartbroken when they found out about the fire.
what caused the fire
烧的好 烧死法国人
It’s a pagan temple anyway!!!
Hope no one was hurt
I call BS. You're telling me the fire dept couldn't access the area because of lookey-loo's? They just stood there like bison while the fire engines blared sirens for two hours? Thats what you're telling me? 
Look that thing had to be burnt down. Now it can be rebuilt as a more inclusive site for 'all' the people in france. Plus, it takes all the attention off the yellow vest protests. What about the other 10 or 12 churches that have been burnt in france over the last month.
This is world history omg!,!!😭😭😭
Shepard Smith cutting off people from France telling their side of the story.
12 Churches destroyed or attacked in Paris since February 2019. This was no accident. "Its not believed to be arson" who are you fooling?
11 churches burned in France in February accident?
Such a terrible thing to happen I was very shocked to see this.  I one day wanted to see this cathedral but I guess not now.....but hey all things must end.
So 20 such fires lit in catholic cathedrals all over the place this week and it's just the biggest coincidence in the world. Come one.
Hope nobody from this country has donated, their problem not ours , did they help when Windsor castle burnt
Omg..a bad omen before Easter!!!
Just rebuild it as a shopping center.
At this time the authorities do NOT know how the fire started. How can they say it was an accident? We will never know the truth.
The Catholic Church is run by demons. BURN!!!
Votre Dame is dead
I wonder how much was it insured for ?
Why are some people in the comments happy about this!?!
where's your god now
When is construction on the new Mosque starting?
So many bad things happening in Paris in the last few years.
i bet it was a careless construction worker
They must rebuild it, whatever it takes to do this!
OMG DID HE JUST SAY PRESIDENT DRUMP???
Best news all day
This was not a boating accident!
Neil Cavuto threw Cardinal Dolan off his show because he had mentioned attacks on other French churches. Too much thinking by the Cardinal?
Where is God ? cannot save his own house ?
I can't believe Jesus let this happen!
how did the fire start and happen?
They will fix it  the books and art work is a shame the building can be fixed
SMOOOOKE IN THE WAAATER!
Arson or terror related?  Nah.
I am on vacation  going to Massachusetts, h
Gonna shred some singletrack tomorrow  can't  wait!!!
Can’t believe that I was once there so sad crying right now plz pray
Who did this, I would be surprised if it was an accident
What the hell?
Who was over there and sees  all the evidence at the time of burning?
So devastating, irreplaceable, unbelievable.  Very suspicious.  Hope to be wrong.
r.i.p. quasimodo
media is controlling the narrative on this. blocking and censoring information.
A lot of people refer to Good's judgement....if I read those phrases I believe the schooling system in the United States is some kind of Good's judgement :-/
You people announced it was an accident the instant you saw the flames. Wonder why...
Absolutely terrible news.
It's horrible .. I live in Paris since birth and this monument is and will be in my heart forever 
It will revives as a phoenix in few years but never the will not be the same as before ..
Prophecy
Ha ha ha, he said President Drumpf.
While I was watching the fire, I kept  wondering where the firefighters were. It wasn't until much much later that the firefighters came; unbelievable that it took them hours to get there when it was almost too late; Think about it: everything about this fire is suspicious; something stinks in Paris.
This is such a tragic day. The world grieves over the loss of a hugely iconic and historically valuable monument. RIP Notre-Dame, 1345-2019
They cut off a French official that was on the scene speaking of the desecrations happening for years now. He told us not to believe the politically correct version!!! They tried to blow it up with a car bomb three years ago. Michelle Obama was sipping wine on her yacht watching One firefighter try and put it out. (((Satanic))) liars!!
It’s crazy to think that I was just recently there and now it’s burning
Hopefully the Dems and leftists won't blame President Trump for the fire!!
Finally some good news
Why wasn't there any fire fighter planes.
MACRONS  Pockets  should  have  been  checked  for  matches.
MACRON  Diagnosed  Psychopath.
Waaaatttttttttt
They should've flown in water!!!1!!
This truly is a tragedy, I won't see this gem in my lifetime in its originality  :(
Who did they hire to do the work? The 3 stooges, the utmost care should have been top priority, just because it was being worked on doesnt rule out arson, actually it opens opportunity for arson. If it is arson they will never admit it.
sins of the father will always visit the daughters and sons. Haiti exploited never to forget or forgive the enemy
The building is made out of fricking stone. There's no physical way possible this could have been an accident. Am I seriously supposed to believe that there could have accidentally been open flames up amongst the roof trusses?

What if a jihadist snuck in amongst the construction workers? Wouldn't that be possible?
Allah o Akbar, God is greatest
MY INTUITION TELLS ME THAT ARABS HAVE SOME INFORMATION ON IT.
Dang! I was going to Paris in a week to see the cathedral!
Karma
accident?  hmmm...
the french are atheists and forgot about god.
0:35 President drump
Vive la revolution!!!
Quasimodo nooo!!!!!
🤣
Now they understand how it felt when the twin towers fell. Time to build something knew there
Need to make room for the newest mosque.
Aww... I’ve always wanted to travel there... so sad😭
Yeah blame tourist for the firefighters not getting there
Judgement day is near people! Repent for The Lord will be returning soon. God bless you all <3
can't they at least have one fire truck close to that building? unacceptable
Tragic.
I heard there were sightings of a very suspicious looking pug dog hanging around and making racist gestures with his right paw at the time the blaze is believed to have been started.
;(
NO ACCIDENT
No no arson
No no terrorism
Notre flame
Bush did it
As a catholic I’m horrified about this happening
Someone’s sending a message to the world. Pleased to meet you , hope you guess my name.
I hope they saved Quasimodo!!!!
Just a joke don’t get triggered cause I know how sensitive you mfs on YouTube are 🙄🙄
Only 180 to 200 years ago, no news would reach people of this fire for years and despite its long lived fame, it is just a building...the statement arsen would make is much more relevant.
If only there was some sort of higher power that had the power to put it out ....
France the First daughter of the Church. This is what happens when you have more tourists than worshippers.
Intentionally set to collect the millions.  It was so dilapidated that it could not be saved.  They conned all those investors.
They are bullshitting and saying structural issues could have caused it..
Cmon we all know who lit it. Diversity is our strength..
Granny
It is truly strange the tubing of the renovation scaffolding did not melt or collapse under the intense heat of this fire.
I would start yelling "let it burn let it burn let it fall down and burn"
that sucks
We all know who did this.
What the what?!
👍👍😎
Paris has fallen.
Given the fact that MAN has corrupted manipulated and controlled religion to control us all, it’s not shocking a false building used for such immense deception is no longer.  The elites house of cards is falling spectacularly
Sad day for all humanity. France needs to do a better job at taking care of its monuments.
I hope leave elui is ok
BellENDcat has blamed two Russian GRU agents who like visiting cathedral spires.
😭😭😭😭😭😭
Only thing sad about this is that all the child molesting priest didn't go up in flames with it!!! Praise God for burning the unjust of the Catholic religion.They have lost there way and  no longer walk with God!
There burning Paris down
Why they still use water ! Instead of Sand ???
😢
😢
Dame
Ichabod
So sad
There’s been 1045 vandalism cases on Churches alone in France over the last 4 years; not Synagogues nor Mosques. Imagine if that number of cases occurred on Mosques alone and then a Mosques “accidentally caught on fire” - CNN would freak out and shout “anti-Semitism!”
Not an accident.
France is shattered anyway.Their people does demo weekly.Time to unite, may this tragedy serve as a lesson for the people of France.
Guess where the newest mosque will be built........
“The gates of hell WILL NOT prevail” - Jesus
This planet is a freewill planet. No structure is worth more than the people's voice. Someone started this fire so they can force more taxes on the French people to pay for the scum who come on boats.
i'm french thanks for the  support by american..a good and great new in this horrible tragedy : firemen have saved the holy crown of thorns of jesus and a piece of cross but others relics (sainte genevieve, etc..) are forever lost..
Rip Quasimodo
:(
we ALL know who did this. just at matter of time to confirm it
:(
I really wanted to visit Paris and see the beauty of it. Till i save enough money. I hope I'll see some of them.
They'll probably build a mosque in its place...
Replace it with a mosque
😢 SMDH yellow vest riots for 2months nothing ND catches fire all eyes on Paris.
I suspect foul play, but whats so disgusting about most mainstream media is even if that is the case they will never admit it.
Fox won’t cover the 3 predominantly black churches burned down by a supposed “unknown assailant”

Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but sounds kinda suspicious that the Cathedral that's managed to withstand over 800 years of harsh environments. Just to all of a sudden collapse in flames as a result of an "accident" on the week leading to Easter.
12 Catholic churches vandalized in 2 months........ yes, the cause was renovations...
Being Catholic in conjunction with the Disney film, visiting Norte Dame was something that was on the top of my bucket list
IN SHOCK ??  YOU MEAN TO SAY THE CITIZENS DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT THE ISLAMIC URBAN RENEWAL ?  A GIANT MOSQUE WILL RISE THERE.
LOL DRUMP NOT TRUMP! OMG IM DYING
What if this is our Heavenly Father pleading with all good Catholics to please turn away from the church and start following Jesus Christ? Jesus is coming back a lot sooner than a lot of people think!
My mom has been in there when she went there
That sucks
Bro yall made it all out of wood. It was bound to happen
There’s a piece of Eden in there
GOOD BABYLON IS STARTING TO BURN.
YAHUAH IS TIRED OF EVIL. HE HEARS THE. CRIES OF HIS PEOPLE. THIS ORGANISATION HAS CAUSED MUCH PAIN AND SUFFERING OF THE SAINTS. YAHUAH HAS HAD ENOUGH. BURN! BABY BURN!
Would anyone be shocked to learn that a certain religious group did this?
Its burning...... ( Looks away )...... Very badly, and it looks like its burning on the ground.




Me: No.....really?



In all Seriousness, I am very sadness to hear a piece of history being destroyed.
There should be a firefighter quarters near such monuments, old buildings are known to catch fire.
The most high judgment is upon us. They will build, but I will tear down says the most high. Repent, keep the commandments or die.
What do you mean Paris?  What about the entire world?   Its so beloved, by Catholics and non-Catholics, French and non-French alike.  I'm not French nor Catholic, and yet I'm devastated.  I just visited it in September!   Please fix it.
Officials said later that the cathedral would be replaced with the world's largest Chuck-E-Cheese. That's real talk and you have to believe me because I said it was real talk.
700 years it stood, it survived WW2. I wonder who set the fire.
Oh, look, he managed to read couple lines. What an overachiever...
Prob a Magaturd arsonist no doubt
Why did the fire trucks take an hour?
💔
Notre Dame was so beautiful. I wanted to see it in real life but I never will. This is just utterly horrible. I don’t know what to do.
I have played Civilization many times, I thought world wonders were indestructible.
Fire and blood
I don’t care.
......A new mosque I take it 😒
всем пиздец!
☮️☮️☮️☮️☮️
Vive la 🇫🇷😭😭😤🙏
Well we all know who did this 
(Thanks Syria)
Rip I read about the notre dame church in a book. I wanted to visit there but...
Quasimodo noooo
圆明园怎么说？？
RIP Quasimodo
What's beneath the church? Inquisitive minds want to know.
Wow
Wow
If only the Rothschild’s and Rockefeller’s were in this fire.
On September 11, the Pentagon had recently undergone construction.  Rien un Americain, un Mexicain, un Noir sait dirais sait serieux quelque chose a la fin.  De'molir.  S'il vient vous reconstruire vous voloir dirais a etre le notre a' l'eglise -- n'est pas me l'eglise.  Vous 'eyal il a fait la femmes comme ca 'cheerleaders' dans l'eglise.  Vous n'est c'est pas a religieus -- vous vendre souvenirs.  Vous voici le salope to pour to bien 'eleve.  Demolir.  The cunning vixen, Elizabeth, surely revels.  Make no mistake.  You sleep with it, monsieur.  There is no pleasing the harlots.
What the Hell!? Why!? It's one of Paris most beloved landmarks how could this happen?
FROOOLOOOOOOO!!!
Omg,
Trump suggested dumping water on the fire from helicopters which would totally collapse the entire building from the weight. The man is clueless.
Everything burns.
Absolutely ridiculous that nothing was done to save Notre Dame cathedral for 2 hours! One of the great wonders of the world is burning, but France takes 2 hours to even TRY to save it!
I wonder if “some people” did this...
:)
the destruction will allow the birthing the new religious order, framed and invented by inclusivists,whatever was is no more,worship is political from here out, not spiritual,only politics has eternal life and immortality, all else is secondary subordinate and heresy if politically authorised,
Varg Vikerness?
I cannot believe all the sarcastic, hateful comments.  This was an international church where people from every corner of the Earth came to see.  I wanted to see it.  This makes me very depressed.    I'm so sad for the people who worshipped there.  If they do rebuild at some point, it'll never be the same.
Didn't even watch this video from Faux News, came here for the comments.
I'm French and from what I've seen it was somehow caused by the construction work (it was being renovated) that was going on ... still unclear though, it will take a few days of investigation to figure out how the fire really started but it spread quickly because most of the structure of this building is made out of wood
omg
One suspects Arson. Something this iconic does not just conveniently burst into flames.
Where was the fake Christian God lol.
President drump
Somebody didn't follow the safety rules in the restoration, hot work permits, fire extinguisher next to a flammable material, fire watchers, cus Everything starts with a little spark,
This is the kind of thing that hapens whens you let animals from third wourld countrys in and alow them to run amuck
Guess a mosque is gonna be rebuilt in it's place.
I noticed they were doing construction outside of the cathedral. My first thought was did somebody cause this from smoking a cigarette?  Not pointing any fingers just a thought?
This isn't the time to rebuild. Think of what that 7 million can do now to people in need. This is an example of mortality. Every thing, no matter how big or small, will come to an end. It's the destiny we all face.
Trump said the problem is that those Parisians never raked out that Cathedral. And he’s right. They never did rake it. 🤔🤷‍♂️
Lol
Lol
I like = pray
It is almost certainly arson but unless someone with proof leaks it the French government will never admit it...................Because if it is arson WE ALL KNOW THE "RELIGION OF PEACE MONGERS" DID IT.
I cannot imagine why it would take 2 hrs for firefighters to get to the fire. Maybe the the cathedral should have been built somewhere else. Oh well, human history gone due to "Oh, we couldn't get to the fire because .............!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well I think it’s just a building. And don’t get me wrong but Jesus didn’t need a super big and luxurious church to teach about God. Let’s forget about material thing and focus on what God want: to be good with others and ourselves. It’s so sad all the history inside of it is burned but at the end, that’s how material thing gonna end, nothing is forever.
Everyone wanna act like a detective, bruh prolly just an accident
sad
Time to forget about religion. Rebuild it and waste millions they will. Fictional stories from a repressive era.
Jesus Christ one of the most elegant and beautiful buildings in the world burned to rubble. If the French government allows this I will gladly donate what little cash I have to rebuild it
Cool nice fire
Very sad...:-(
This is the 3rd Temple beta test..
Im gonna be shocked honestly if the president actually helps out.
That was built 800 years ago. Wow
But, it couldn't survive Macron.
Cháy hết mẹ đi
How
well it is karma for harrasing kids and studf like that
My heart has been saddened by this. Even though I have just learned about this in social studies   I still loved it. I hope it will be rebuilt
Oh jesus,  it's kills me within
It is God's punishment. Catholic is a full of gays. That is why God starts his punishment everywhere.

burn baby burn
This is truly awful. I'm just glad that no one got hurt and that the fire got contained. Hopefully everything gets restored
Probably arson by one of those kind and thoughtfull refugees
Is it just me or I can’t see how many likes a comment has
This is just a start on the attack on Western Civilization. 
Well what do you expect France? Your open borders is your ruin.
NO BUILT IN FIRE EXTINGUISHERS [sprinkler system etc.] = FRAUD + Insurance + Mass manipulaion = Herd the sheep.
Lol even the old buildings don’t want Macron
It just kinda sucks
very suspicious
So-called Native and Hispanics this is how we got to the America's  before European people came here straight from the Bible.... 
2 Esdras 13 Vs 40-45

40 Those are the 10 tribes, which were carried away prisoners out of their own land in the time of  Osea the king, whom Salmanasar the king of Assyria led away captive, and he carried them over the waters, and so they came into another land. 
41 But they took counsel among themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the heathen, and go forth into a further country, where never mankind dwelt, 
42 That they might there keep their statutes, which they never kept in their own land.
43 And they entered into Euphrates by the narrow places of the river.
44 For the Most High then shewed signs for them, and held still the flood, till they were passed over. 
45 For through that country there was a great way to go, namely, of a year and a half: and the same region is called Arsareth.
We are now living in a new, MUCH NEEDED, time where all EVIL shall NOT prevail anymore!!!
President Trump had the right idea! Where were the tankers ... why didn’t someone approve dropping water from helicopters ... the river is right there! This would have been worth the expense. Words are not going to fix this one ... it’s a terrible-terrible tragedy. Comfort each other

Deep Breaths and Baby Steps ... Be Well Everyone.  I am Christöff
As an African if nobody died then good. It was built on hate
Why does it seem that this footage invokes thoughts of End Times....
Omg!!! Did Quasimodo get out on time?!? 😱
HAHAHAHA Fox News saw that the comments getting up votes were not in sympathy for the church so they disabled the likes/dislikes on comments! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
In 1963, on the initiative of culture minister André Malraux and to mark the 800th anniversary of the Cathedral, the facade was cleaned of the centuries of soot and grime, restoring it to its original off-white color.  Stones damaged by air pollution were replaced, and a discreet system of electrical wires, not visible from below, was installed on the roof to deter pigeons.  Another major cleaning and restoration program was commenced in 1991...A water reservoir, covered with a lead roof, is located between the two towers, behind the colonnade and the gallery and in front of the nave and the pignon.  It can be used to quickly extinguish a fire.  The Cathedral's flèche or spire, which was destroyed in the April 2019 fire, was located over the transept and altar. (Wikipedia)
All praise to God the Almighty.  John 3:16.  Do not worship objects or buildings or statues.
NOOOO
Yellow vests? Their sick of what's going on in their country, fires, bombs, no telling, will soon start around the world, America maybe next, we're sick of these far left liberals, u never know, we the people will keep our country in tact, by any means necessary.
It’s sickening that people can joke about a very meaningful building that survived WW1 and WW2 is burning after surviving territories attacks and was able to stand 856 years and everyone is blaming it on a certain race and discriminating because of what other people did from that race. It makes no sense why people have to be spreading hate, and why everyone isn’t spreading hope and prayers because today everyone has lost a very important place, religious or not this is a time to spread peace, hope, and love to everyone.
😯
Islamic Arsonists? Hmm...
Damnable hunchbacks at it again! Probably chasing after gypsy women... See! Let them ring the bell, next thing you know they're burning the whole cathedral down!
Mysterious. Another Terrisom attack?  Or sun fire?
Sad
Fox News is a JOKE! Around ELEVEN church burnings and desecrations in France in the last two months! And Cavuto and his knob slobbering boyfriend Shep Smith try to hide it from the American people and do this!? Shame on them they should be fired!
Nothing To See Here....Just Burning Up The Evidence....L0L...
My French teacher is probably going to freak out god plz help me
Looks like Macron's refugees are adding some diversity, a mosque will most likely be built on the ashes of Notre Dame.
If they would grow up and stop using energy weapons on everything we would not have a problem. Just like all their negative sick stuff. Who they, well the public sure can not afford energy weapons. Who do you think. They pulled this sick stunt way to many times and if you can not tell that place was getting hit with an energy weapon. Step aside. Your one of the major problems.
Accident???...
Fox news reporting is looking for more Drama. Saying Compassion with over dramatization with sensational reporting is ruining everything, not Notre Dame. A standing symbol of France history (at least give some fact on ND educate people not just talk ruins, e.g.,  tell about De Sully roles and the completion years. To rebuild a medieval Catholic cathedral will require Compagnons du Devoir et du Tour de France, the craftsman. Take the French definition culture of equality fraternity and liberty, and this Magnificient place will be rebuilt as back in the 1200s, with a forest of oak if needed. I hear Trump & Co.unthought construct of mind to suggest planes to be used for fire fighting! Seriously that's is the News?. No blame here to be found please but hope to rebuild without blaming or for gain.  Sorry Fox, we know humility truly does not improve your rating. I am French American to be precise! In the house of GOD we TRUST.
They will probably blame trump for it
Everything Trump touches, dies!
I knew that shouldn't have released my mix tape there
Good thing the fire was caused:) I wanted to die in there. :)
Maybe at her 860th birthday ( in 2023 ) she can sing again with all her beauty !
Oh my god! I’ve always wanted to visit! I’m just a 12 yr old girl so I have no idea.
So? What’s so important that it has to be all over the news? OH it’s The West’s main religion.
Cathedral burned itself in protest against sodomy and islamization of Europe.
ISIS is cheering I bet
Just a burning iconic church, why would we possibly believe otherwise right..
Why is everyone complaining about the firefighters taking so long? What do you want them to do, run over the hundreds of people watching? And, firefighters off duty would have to be called in, meaning they'd have to arrive at the station, get prepared, and hop on a truck. It's honestly pathetic. They're risking their lives to save this part of history, yet people are like "oMg tHeY aRe tAkiNg tOo LoNg"
Invite your enemy into your home and they will burn it to the ground.
Heartbreaking. Symbolism on the current state of Christianity.
Who is secretly celebrating?  British Anglicans, USA Episcopalians, and members of the Huguenot Society of America, all historically in conflicts with Rome and Catholics.
Isn’t this kind of, I don’t know, embarrassing for France? I mean, it’s one of the most important buildings in the whole country (quite frankly, whole of Europe) and it survived two world wars and a revolution only to be burned down because of some renovations? The French government also owned the building and partially funded the renovations, so shouldn’t there have been more precautions in place to prevent accidents like this? 

I get that fire can spread quickly, but they don’t start for no reason. And Notre Dame hasn’t ever caught on fire in its 800 year history.
What a shame it's burned down.
So very sad 😢 for France.   Why two hours ?   That is ridiculous.    Just like they could not get the late Princess Diana to a hospital.   It took two hours.  Something wrong with France's first responders system it seams.
Do we know the cause? I'm a bit skeptical with all that is going on in Paris.  Keeping an open mind but skeptical.  I would donate to help rebuild 100%.
No matter how much you hate the religion this is still a tragic event. That building holds so much history, so many paintings from times long past. One of the stained glass windows broke and will never be able to be replaced the same way ever again because how they used to do stained glass when that window was made is now lost to us.
Sad news such a historical heritage destroyed. Fire fighters took so long because of..... sounds like situation in South Asian countries. Welcome to the group!
Poor Paris I feel so sorry my mom said we were gonna visit it when I’m old enough 😓😥😰
Oh how fun! Things die.. oh well.
The title is inaccurate. The spire has been destroyed. The Cathedral still stands.
So sad. I'm so very sorry to the Paris citizens that are going to miss Notre Dame. I hope no lives got hurt/killed?  But,,, 
I've never seen smoke rise from a large burning structure like this before, with such a bright-reddish color to it ,,,such-as-this'(???)...
     Is it the camera'? Or because of the old materials that the ancient building is made from or what'(????). Hmm IDK! ... ... ...
😆😆😆
It's a sign from God. End times are near. Get ready world. Madness will soon beginning..
Que bien que quemen  iconos de maldad que son masonicos o illuminatis  ojala se quemaan todo iconos catholicisme semillas de maldad y Fuentes de pedofilos
Prayers for Paris 🙏
Why don't they do what they do on forest fires and have planes dump boatloads of whatever they dump on forest fires. But that takes thought and France is liberal sooooo nevermind.
Just a building God will be just fine he's Really not into buildings if you're saved your the temple of the Holy Spirit
COMMENT HERE with your thoughts about ILHAN OMAR comparing the US Military to Al-Qaeda (Tucker). Fox cowardly disabled comments, again!
How can CNN blame Trump for this?
0:36 did he actually say "president drump" lol
Who also wants to guess another act of terrorism?
It stands proud for over 850 years and within a few of years of Islamic invasion, it burns down.? That building was far too busy a place for a fire to go unnoticed and grow into an inferno. I smell a rat and its name is Macron, he's a low life for sure. If the French think this was an accident they are in more trouble than they could ever imagine.
What a pleasant news  ，Did they think of this when they were burning the Summer Palace
France and the media were quick to say not arson .How do they know without a thurough investigation ? 
It started on the roof during a Holy time for Christians . Another old church was set on fire not long ago and we know France has taken in a lot of Christian haters .
Retaliation for Christchurch. Possibly
My little sister is in Paris near there she is only 13!
The plates will be rattling after Sunday mass this week. God is all powerful, he's just not good with money.
'm sorry for dong this but.... The elitists have done this since the beginning of time. If they are in political trouble they create a disaster with nationalistic foundations. The burning of Notre Dam is a perfect example. Nationalism left to the populous creates things like french bread and berets. In the hands of politicians it's used to divert attention from their failings by provoking the citizens to sacrifice their liberty to the power of the establishment. Marcon had too much to gain by destroying the church. What better way to shut the yellow vests down and preserve the power of the establishment.
Guaranteed that a massive mosque will take its place.
BEEN SHOWING THE ARTIFACTS THEY SAVED. SO TOUCHING AND BEAUTIFUL. SHOWED THE STANDING STRUCTURE THAT IS LEFT STANDING. HUGE GOLD CROSS LIKE A BEACON, STILL ATTACHED AND ON THE BACK WALL, NOT BURNT AND SAFE. O YES, JESUS REIGNS STILL AND FOREVER
Haha....
Don't worry a Mosque will be built in its place to calm the virtues of the citizens
I think I'm reading it exactly right. He thinks and writes like a demented third grader.
I'm not religious in the least bit, but religion aside it's the history that matters. This is so fuckin sad. Paris is beautiful. Even the Nazis saw that. Just.....wow.
Very little chance if it ever getting rebuilt. The workman's daily pay when they started building it was two lashes with a whip and a crust of bread dipped in pig fat.
Deutsche hier?😂
Lord and holy Mary have mercy for France.
This is a sign that we have to get much closer to our lord Jesus Christ.
People are forgetting about him in this Holy Week.
My prayers for France. 🇫🇷 
From Sevilla Spain 🇪🇸 to all the people and the beautiful Notre Dame of Paris.
They will rebuild it and turn it into a dam mosque
Why is there a bearded man in a white dress caught on camera walking around the balcony?
Would they say if it was terrorism?
Notre Dame is just one of the hundreds of Christian churches desecrated and damaged in the last couple years.  It's no coincidence.
When they colonized and looted others,they didn't give pity to the cultures they destroyed.
Hope it was a careless mistake and everyone is ok, however I can think of a few groups who might desire to burn it on purpose.
😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂😅😂😅🤣😘😄🤣😄🤣😄🤣😄😂😄😂😄🤣😄🤣😅😂😂😄😂😅😄😂😄😂😅🤣😄🤣
7 million renovation, no security?
The American loony tunes liberals are going to try to tell us that God is punishing France for being racist or that God is punishing the Catholics because of (insert insult here).   They are probably getting their notes together already.  Just give them a day or so to put their mouths in gear.
They had time to put it on the news, but not time to put it out? Or prevent it?
That’s a heck of an orange fire. Wonder what caused it? Seems tragically ironic.
Hey Fox News , you skipped the part where trump thinks notre Dame is a museum
One week before 2 major Christian celebrations... and it started 15 min. after closing for the day... accident?... arson?... religious, cultural, or political terrorism?... or an insurance scam? Who does it hurt most and who benefits most?....
Can we have f's in the chat for the fellow Catholics.
Wow I hope the Hunchback made it out
Chinese people send congratulatory telegram，Congratulations to the French people on their success  。For the old Summer Palace
This is no other then the religion of peace work, I guarantee you and they will not tell the public because they know this would be the last straw !!! Do not kid yourself , this is a statement , a massive statement !!!!the firefighter couldn't go because they were afraid of other explosive or attack to the first responder !
There's been 10 other churches burnt and vandalized recently. Now it seems strange that they all just accidentally burned, especially with the vandalism also occurring Who would hate Christianity that much, I'm just perplexed..........not really.
Too bad helicopters with water drums weren't used.  Could only have helped..
"Some people did something" AGAIN ...
Don't worry people Wal-Mart will build a super center in there
Religion of peace doing this
Western Europe and the Americas have been ignoring God and their Christian foundation for decades. Perhaps this unfortunate event will soften a few hearts toward God. ( Being a realist, I am not going to hold my breath waiting! ) If you are looking for God in a building, you will not find him; He is found in the hearts of His believers.
Bad omen for Europe and the west .
Islamic attack.
So what happened? I feel like the government is burning everything that has information of the past. They did it before what makes you think they won’t do it again.  Like right now they are building trees over all 64 pyramids on earth. They are hiding everything.... but dang that’s sad.. wanted to visit Paris to see this building ):
It's a more terrible sight to behold a disgusting fraud acting as an American President trying to comment on an event he's so disgustingly contaminated by poison to even comment on....
Which "religion of peace" is behind it, I wonder ... ?
Don't worry france, we will bail you out again, and with the Lords will. smh at this. so much of a loss, but the enemy will be in flames soon
For everyone affected by this I feel for you. 🙏🏼
Don’t worry Macron will build a nice mosque there instead!
Sad, but they'll fix it. Hopefully everyone there was fine.
ISIS is demonising europe beware and don't be coward else there is no hope .Marriane is in danger , Marriane is insulted and Marriane crying ...wake up
Christianity is dead in Europe.. Build a church without Jesus and all you have is a warehouse.. The French will never spring for the cost of rebuilding Notre Dame.. There is a better chance that a mosque would be built as a replacement.. We are watching not only the end of an era but the end of western civilization in Europe.. I hope the looney left is happy.. They will reap what they have sown...
7M!?
Notre Dame is falling down, falling down, falling down. We got the London bridge and now we got Notre Dame.
And naturally Trump embarrassed himself by saying that water tankers (water bombers but hell, he is stupid) should drop water on the building. Guess he cant figure out that the building is very fragile and would not be able to withstand that.
I’m an atheist and honestly this is heartbreaking, this has nothing to do with god or religions, it’s a terrible loss for the history of mandkind, you have to be freaking stupid to be happy about this...
Don't be naïve, I don't think it's a coincidence that it was holy week and 12 other churches in France have been vandalized lately. This has to be the work of Islamic Extremists! Get them out of your countries!
Remember WAY back in 2016 Islamists were caught with a car full on explosives parked next to the cathedral? Or on 2017 when an Islamist attacked Christian's leaving the cathedral with a butcher knife, or in 2018 when ISIS propaganda videos showed the Cathedral in flames?......
Notre Dame of Paris is the very pinnacle of Gothic architecture, dating back to the 12th century(pre renaissance period). 

Many non-christians will suffer the consequences of their existence now.
Это что??? Я из России кек:)А потомучто я русский, это не значит , что я, делающая свинья, кек:)
NOT LIKELY CONSTRUCTION .
It was only a sepulcher anyhow
CROCODILE TEARS!!!. Since 2013, over 2,000 Catholic churches have been demolished in France (example 16th-century Saint Peter's cathedral in Gesté) to build parking spaces, department stores or mosques. They plan the demolition of another 800 churches. Whoever destroys his own culture and tradition dies. France is already dead.
Oof
Notre Dame Cathedral will be replaced by a mosque with huge minarets.
Stone structures don't "burn to the ground"
get the hunch back ….HE DID IT
Y Las k faltan
It’s a sign which foretells the start of what is going to happen to the catholic religion. And just not just the catholic religion, but all religion.
Surprise?
Im absolutely devastated my favorite movie is the Hunchback of Notre Dame and because of that movie I always wanted to see the real Notre Dame
No point rebuilding, its gone.
Nooo
Horrible news. God is trying to wake you up, France! Turn to him before it's too late!
Look on the brightside, it lasted 800 years.  And it is not needed any longer as the French people are nearly all apostates.
not terror related? The Notre Dame cathedral burns on the same day that the Boston Marathon bombings occurred back in 2013? and its not terror related?!
The Catholic Church is completely evil and satanic! Glad it burned!
ITS A 4 11 ATTACK ON DEMOCRACY CIVIL WAR WOOOO # MAGA
The church in India was burnt to the ground and now this.. Hhhmmmm i wonder who done it let's have a wild religion of peace guess
God is a true treasure that will last forever. The church not the building but God's people is the church is going to last
2hrs for firefighters to arrive!?!?! Are u people buying this shite? And they already know what caused it and it wasn’t the invaders so don’t even go there 😉
Neuter Dame. Call insurance company
2 hours for fire fighters seems unacceptable. Why so long??
😥😥😥
Hmm... I wonder who might be responsible.
No worries . Saudia Arabia will build a mosque there
Notre Dame on fire is an appropriate symbol for the state of the Western World in Europe.
Stop importing terrorism
×
Wonder if the religion of peace had anything to do with it?
.
COMMUNISM SHALL PREVAIL COMRADES!
cant France pay for it themselves, stop asking other countries to pay for it,wasnt it insured? only rich people that can afford a trip even know the place exists, pay for it yourself !
In before the government blames yellow vests👀
President Drump...  lol. Oh sorry.😳
That’s a chemical fire wood...burns black not white! 2 hours to respond? Well they had to make sure all there sins were covered! I’m sorry but the building burning is tragic the reason WHY? Is appalling!
I hope everyone sees this comment, but you don't have any idea how happy are the refugees in Paris asking to add fuel to the cathedral and make a mosque in it's place, and many photos of them laughing in front of it burning. May europe unite to face the evil they're letting in their countries.
Burn baby burn....said Omar.
Good, may Allah burn u all.
Hope the invading powers now know the pain of ppl in invaded countries when they destroyed their culture and heritage and looted the country of their riches....karma has its own sweet story to tell...it will take its own sweet time but it will give back whatever u have done in the past...
What a waste. That is a valuable piece of French History. It is almost symbolic destroying a christian cathedral, destroying Christianity in France through secularism or Islamism.
Sad. But this was an accident. Many world heritage and artifacts destroyed by war and intentionally by idiots.
My heart goes out to France. But remember fellow Christians.  The Cathedral may fall but our Faith can remain standing!
i think this was planned tbh
99.9999 percent chance this was caused by Islamic terrorists. Not from the work. Attacks of Church's in Europe have been on the rise. Make no mistake of what this really is.
This is just one late event of recent years that are tied to the verse Babylon is Fallen -God has been pouring vengence upon  that idolatry catholic group BUT PEOPLE "WONDER" after the beast who is being slowly consumed out of his place-Was palm sunday  like 'sunday " as they were open only for toursist $$$$$$$not a mass service good that is was closed!And all you Prodies your no better than your Big C brethren protestant groups are as a cage of fowls demon filled so called mega -sepulare churches!
Stop spending billions of dollars to build this terrible testimony to Catholic power and abuse. Put the billions towards helping everyone in France not just white Catholics. Such a racist society like the rest of Europe!
this is the SJW's 9/11 moment. They care more about art than people.
Funny how so many people are supposedly heartbroken by this, and I bet very few are even Christians.
Thanks drump
0:36 present drump
These Marxists will use it as the Reichstag fire.
How did Trump cause that? Cigarette, torch, he triggered a snowflake?
Its a building, get over it.
how did the fire start? Who was in the attic when the fire started? The workmen in the attic taking out statues for restoration, what are their backgrounds? Something is very suspicious here. This was a Catholic church. Represented Christianity for centuries. Just saying.
I am NOT in shock. Nothing in France is shocking me anymore. French kalifat is collapsing !  Mikron is finishing off France...
Let me guess, the Vatican has a RENOVATION project scheduled for later some time this year...
Let it burn .... if you want to cry about something .... Jesus was tortured and killed ... where are your tears for him ???
Godzilla has had confirmed sightings in Paris.
Were Bush & Cheney around ? Bet the Vatican had it heavily insured ... unless its part of the Clinton Foundation
It is impossible for them to have already come to the conclusion it wasn't arson or terrorism unless someone has come forward and said it was their fault.
oooos myz gowdz. a billden burntz to da ground. I have more sympathy for the world trade center instead.
If u guys do some history from the year 538 AD to 1798 and from 1798 to the 11 of February 1929 and from 11 of February 1929 to the 11 off February 2013 and wat happen 3 Times on the roof of the Vatican on the 11 of February 2013 you all will understand how prophetic that is read the biok of daniel and also revelation chapter's 12 and chapter 13
Poor hunchback.he has a warm bum...such a shame do hope they can rebuild it
Terrorism, arson or message to pedo's? Oh, or due to renovations? Like we will ever know. My guess is solvents were used regardless. The smoke has a lot of yellow to it.
Macron will probably build a church mosque combination obamination...

Never mind.they are already talking about rebuilding with more present day France..one that reflects what France is about now..there ya have it.
They say as night fell the Gargoyles awakened to save it.
The stupidity of the French government is responsible for this tragedy.
Buh bye, Paris. They killed you for me.
They will replaced with a mosque coz France is full off illegal immigrants now
Oh dear!! Ah well at least it wasn't on my list, places to visit. Still on track.
Somehow I don’t think the leaders of Paris are very shocked. Hint hint
Trump: "It's burning, burning very badly, looks like it burning to the ground, some stones may be saved and used in the wall unless they burn up too".
0:37 president "drump"
IT'S NO MYSTERY THE INVADERS SET THE HISTORIC EUROPEAN BUILDING ON FIRE
I don't know much about white culture historical buildings.  I cannot feel or empathize, but my sympathies to the white people who lost this building. Maybe they will put a nice patch of green grass after the clean up.
Shep Smith should be fired and replaced with Rep. Ilhan Omar or Rep. Rashida Tlaib or any member of ISIS so at least we know where the MSM sympathies lie.
i was watching this from ze window... and i was crying i could not stand to stare at this beautiful church just burn down.
because the reconstruction was done by migrants. they bring trouble europe
Fox runs interference. You really want to live in a world without Europe and Europeans you degenerates?
wow, awful. who gets the insurance $ then?
See what cheap labor gets u?
God got tired of the evil in there and destroyed it
Maybe the French government caused this to bring the people together? France has gone through a lot in the past months, so maybe a national emergency will bring the people together and France will gain money for it so the cost of living will go down.
MACRONS  Pockets  should  have  been  checked  for  matches.
MACRON  Diagnosed  Psychopath.
An edifice, this iconic, belongs to the whole world. My heart is heavy.
France I’m so sorry; But Christ lives within! Dear God please help all of us In this time of need, in Jesus’s name I pray, amen
2-hours to arrive in a city = failed city planning or failed updated codes. OR it means this was intentional and EVERYthing you hear from the news will be fabricated. WHY did Trump mention that it looks like the entire thing will burn down? Foreshadowing or accidentally spilling the beans?
It's ok EU will pay for repair .😖
Quasimodo "She gave me water"
Esmeralda "That's to put out the fire that you started you daft bat"
May Allah save churches , mosques , temples and synogogs and aĺl places of worship
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA😂🤣😂😁🤣😂😃
Aw so sad. And Trump still made us look like idiots.
All holidaze that have absolutely nothing to do with the Biblical feast days of the Most High YHWH, looks like the imposters are getting the rebuke from Him.
We can blame Judge Claude Frollo.
Very tragic , but beautiful how all people , ( no matter the religion ) come together as one through these hard times .
Just checking to see if foxtards are as deplorable as they say.  Yup.
Doesn't this seem a little suspicious to anyone else?
Out of all the famous buildings in Europe it just happens to be one of the most well-known and oldest symbols of Christianity in the world that gets destroyed.
Well said Trump!🤭🤣
Firstly, my heart goes out to all the firefighters who worked so hard and bravely to save Notre Dame. If any of you are reading this, merci. 
Secondly, can everyone in the comments stop with the stupid, childish conspiracy theories? As far as we know right now, this fire wasn't arson. Just stop. Sometimes tragedies really are just devastating accidents.
My heart is breaking
Seems like a sign for the French. Go back to true Catholicism. Time to wake up.
This happened thanks to those dumb democrats who want anarchism to prevail! Please Mr. President help us
yess yessssss I am happy that a church got destroyed! lol
It started in the attic, why didn’t the workers try to stop it? It was small when it started
Uh oh, Trump said the word "behold"  He has now graduated from the 3rd grade
French deserve this.
They stole the Egyptian obelisks during their occupation and so far still in Paris. 
🤣🤣😋😋😋😋
The church is on fire for their sins and pedophilia.
France is burning to the ground. Don't mention the other churches being lost.
Did they blame Trump yet ?
I blame global warming.
It was just a building.
Макрону надо ещё попросить одну гэдээровскую ш....у,чтобы она ему передала "великой Франции" пару сотен тысяч мусульманских "бэжэнцеффф"(="сирийские врачи и атомные энергетики"), вот тогда по Монмарту можно будет только в "бронике" перебиратся, держа в руках верное "весло" с двойным рожком под гулкие очереди крупнокалиберных...😌
Hmm. It’s just a building folks. Such buildings are also very expensive to maintain.
Que feo
We all know it was some islamatard.......
sarah huckabee you should have stayed with your hubby quasimodo in the tower  🤣
Everything burns!🔥🤪
Highly suspicious.
But it hasn't burned down! It's seen tremendous damage but the external structures seem safe, which is 95% of what people associate with the cathedral. Take an example of literally any photo anyone has taken of Notre Dame, it's going to be of the front facade and the towers, which have thankfully not been destroyed.

They've more than likely saved the internal art and religious relics. The organ, windows, roof and spire are more than likely destroyed, but the roof and spire are not original and were being replaced anyway! It's an awful event but thankfully it seems like it's not lost, and no major disaster.
Not arson? Press x to doubt
So sad,
When was this published???
Let it burn
deus vult lmao
Como se ensendio
.......
Americans destroyed it
Strange that it would be a cathedral...not a mosque.
Strange...isn't it?
Well, if you ever doubted for second that Trump is an imbecile, look at his tweet on the fire. He offers firefighting advice ("flying water tankers") as if he knows squat about the subject and as if hundreds of experts in the field weren't already involved (and we now know any water from above would have destroyed more of the cathedral and its contents), and then to top it off, urges that they "must act quickly", because of course without that instruction from the all-knowing Trump, everyone would have dawdled as one of France's greatest and most historic buildings burned. Any of course not a word of sympathy for the citizens of France nor any encouragement for those battling the blaze. What an effing embarrassment. What a tool. Every day he finds a new way to humiliate our country.
Cathedrals without Christians.    (?)   500 years to get there.
To my surprise, one hundred stories high
People getting loose y'all, getting down on the roof

This hurt me from the deeps of my soul :c
How come Donald Trump is the first or is always very early to always respond to such things?
Bruv why doesn’t it just resurrect itself on Easter
News  reports 
that  on  15 
April  ,  2019 
,  a  massive 
fire  gutted  Notre –Dame 
Cathedral  in  Paris 
,  shocking  those 
across  the  world 
who  learnt  about 
it.  French  President 
Macron  has  announced 
that  they  would 
rebuilt  it.  In 
this  context  , 
it  is  apt 
to  bring  out 
here  two  articles 
of  this  Vedic 
astrology  writer  alerting 
likelihood  of  huge 
fire  or  such 
like  worrisome  concern 
in  France  calling 
for  more  care 
and  appropriate  strategy. 
The  two  related 
articles  brought  to 
public  domain  much 
prior  are  as 
follows  :-





(A).  World 
Predictions  2019;





(B).  World 
Trends  in  April 
to  August  2019.





The  article 
- “  World  Predictions 
2019”  - covering  first 
three  months  of 
2019  ,  more 
so  February  -March 
,  was  brought 
to  public  domain 
in  November  ,  2018.  While 
indicating  some  countries 
of  world  in 
the  predictive  alerts 
in  relation  to 
some  worrisome  concerns 
,  France  was 
also  mentioned.  Yes 
,  certain  protests 
in  Paris  were 
perceived  to  be 
relating  to  the 
alert.  Since  the 
period  covered  was 
over  by  March 
2019  ,  the 
planetary  impacts  were 
read  further  and 
it  was  felt 
that  these  do 
not  look  to 
be  calming  down  for  further 
more  time   beyond 
March   in  2019. 
This  occasioned  writing 
of  another  article 
- “ World  Trends  in 
April  to  August 
2019”  -  brought 
to  public  domain 
towards  end  of 
March  and  first 
week  of  April 
in  2019.  A  list  of 
worrisome  concerns  was 
included  in  the 
said  article  which 
also  had  - “ 
fire  and  blasts 
,  in  addition 
,  can  cause 
worry”  -  calling 
for  more  care 
and  appropriate  strategy. 
The  countries  were 
urged  to  check 
up  vulnerability  factor  
for  such  more 
care  and  appropriate 
strategy  during   mid –April 
to  August  in 
2019  ,  making 
a  total  period 
of  four  and 
half  months.  It 
seems  the  alert 
was  meaningful  though 
it  may  not 
have  come  to 
notice  of  the 
concerned.
When the mass is too lit
If only the same occured to mosques worldwide
Would be tears of joy.
Hmmm...I wonder...I wonder what (or who) started the fire...
I wonder...
Politically motivated arson.
Man Satan must be really mad.
Government started it....next they will blame whoever they want gone.
0:07 Oh no
What, 2 hours?!!! This is so enraging, incompetence  at it's highest level.
A crying shame...so sad. Good to hear that they plan to rebuild.
President Drump
As long as no one was hurt, that is all that matters. I wouldn't cry over materialistic things, it can be rebuilt.
Fue el jorobado xD
Sad day for Europe, France, Paris, and yes president Trump the world.....
Religion of peace, they said
I blame Disney.
Four churches within one week. The end times are here. I fear for the Christians for what is to come.
such a loss of history
France is no longer France
To bad trump wasn’t in that fire
Babylon Burning...Smoke and Fire... Let it burn Let it burn... the wicked shall not survive!!!
The Catholic church, literally going up in flames....adios!!
Being part of the catholic church... it was probably burn on purpose to for the Catholics to collect the insurance money
415... never forget
Never got to visit it
Crap I always wanted to go to the noterdam cathedral
Wow God is in control
If they couldnt' get in by streets why didn't they using copters dropping water or planes dropping flame retardant like they do with forest fires.
THANK GOD for TRUMP    if it  werent for  him  i wouldnt   have  known it  was a  fire   ,i thought it was a  tsunami
Muslimoto did it. The crusades will begin again. The news will lie but the truth will come out.
illuminate
/👁\
Paris is burning
It’s burning very badly, not a good sight.
NOOOOOOOO!
oh
NO NO NO NO!
My heart is with Paris 😔
It's  amazing  how  hateful  humans  can be to each other  . We've really learned  nothing being here  .
That's going to be the place with the holy seat that the anti Christ sits in.... You guys watch Satan replaced the savior with jesus, follow the law.
So sad, I wanted to go there in the future, as a catholic Iraqi it is like a dream for us to visit holly place like that
The Catholic religion is so corrupt God’s wrath
Satan is well within the Catholic Church.
Its time to build a mosque there
Ça c’est drumage
Obviously deliberately lit just when the Church is closed and during peak hour traffic.
I was there
Damm I don't like history getting engulfed in flames am sad so much history gone please dont burn books
I'm surprised France didn't surrender and let the fire take the whole thing down.
La profecía de la casa en llamas 🔥 está cumplida  🙏
Omg y what happened to it😨😨😨😦😱😱😱😡
I don’t care about religion whatsoever, but the sight of this cathedral burning down is a shame. It has such beautiful architecture and historical importance. It really is a shame....
God is mad at them 🤦🏻‍♀️ because French President talked out of his a.. abt Trump 🤦🏻‍♀️ !!! Very very sad 😔

Jupiter is in France.. Say hello to the AC people..
I found out during science today, I was shocked
Quasimodo’s crying tonight.
God does not reside in any man made building. In fact, he slaughtered his own people when they erected a statue in his honor, when he said not to. That church was just another false idol. Let it all burn down, for the house of God is in heaven. But, then again, catholics are nothing short of idol worshipers, and for that, he says you will be spewed out of his mouth.
I hope old Hunchie got out ok.😢
If only poor Francis was in this fire.
They'll re-build it with your carbon tax $$$ just watch.   Macron worked for the Rothchilds....  he's a money man.... pay up France
Baby are you a church? Cause you smokin'!
All these people with faux tears over the destruction of a cultural landmark. Most are not a part of its religion and sell out their culture to foreigners. Now when a tourist attraction burns they are upset - this is their idea of “culture”. Something on postage stamps.
Hundreds of churches attacked in Germany and France last year.
10 in France in one month this year.
They are so scared of saying who is behind these attacks.
Google and read the truth.
