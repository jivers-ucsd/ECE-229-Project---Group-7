Why are people so mad at Game of Thrones?,"May 13, 2019",78983,5017,4248761,"The final season of Game of Thrones, and especially the last 3 episodes, have divided and angered many fans of the show. But why? Well, there are a number of reasons for this, so let’s break down the biggest and most recent problem first - Daenerys.In last night’s episode, Daenerys and Drogon rain fire down upon King’s Landing, killing thousands of innocents. This is all after Cersei’s armies have surrendered. Now the show’s writers justify this by claiming it’s the Mad King storyline coming full circle with his daughter. And, if the show had more episodes and time to develop this extreme choice, it could have made more sense. But we’re only given 6 episodes this season, as opposed to the usual 10, and the decision to make Daenerys the “Mad Queen” seems rushed and hasty.Throughout the seasons, we’ve seen Daenerys promise she’s nothing like her father, as she’s freed slaves and ruled mostly benevolently. So last night’s episode largely felt like a betrayal to both fans and her very character. An entire city going up in flames makes for a great visual, sure, but narratively it’s questionable. Now it appears Daenerys is the show’s “Big Bad,” and not Cersei.And that’s another big problem - Cersei and her fate. Fans were out for blood and wanted a gruesome end for the cold-hearted tyrant. But instead of getting a knife in the heart (like many predicted), she fell victim to rubble. Now one could argue that Daenerys ultimately killed Cersei...but her end still seems somewhat anticlimactic. And that doesn't even begin to address Jaime's problem.Jaime's redemption arc - where'd it go?! The Lannister most changed from a character standpoint after years of questioning his actions and his loyalty to his lover went back to his old ways all too quickly. In the previous episode, after leaving Brienne, fans had hoped he was on his way to King's Landing just to finish Cersei off himself. But this latest episode proved - NOPE! - he just wanted one last cuddle with his sister-lover. Hm.In conclusion, we only have 1 episode left, and frankly I’m excited to see where this all goes.GREEN SCREEN VERSION: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZwkU..."

Let's Abstract Paint,"Jan 16, 2019",276785,1514,5416351,"Here is the lovely channel, SurajFineArts, that inspired me to make this video https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0DA...There are lots of other videos on youtube of this style of painting but over christmas break I was finding myself throwing this channel on and absolutely passing the fuck out to it because it was so r e l a x i n g. I also enjoy people who make content that makes something that seems a little scary (like making art ((DONT LAUGH AT ME ART PEOPLE OKAY YALL WOULD BE SCARED IF I CLOMPED NEXT TO YOU AT 6'11 AND BOWLED YOU UNDER THE TABLE)) seem so accessible to people like me who have absolutely no idea what they are doing or how or where to start.  Trying new things is really fun and fulfilling (as you can also see I HAVE BEGUN GROWING THE HOUSEPLANTS, someday maybe I'll give you a plant tour, let me know after you comment ""hang it this way"" if you'd like to see that someday maybe after their growing season in the spring/summer when they get all luscious and beautiful.). Anyways, it's enjoyable sometimes to just do 32 year old lady things, I appreciate you guys encouraging me to paint and do art even though I'm a little virgo-y at times, a little too much at times, and a little less than confident at times.  It means a lot.  I'm going to keep trying and maybe someday I'll be an art person with art things surrounded by art so much art I can't even function I'm just swimming in art okay I have to go Kermit is screaming at me because he wants to sit in my lap one of my plants is named Bjork okay bye.

Mr. Marbles Is Toothless,"Dec 12, 2018",284272,1033,4811092,"Again I apologize that this was not the video I had planned on making today and Marbles is doing really well, it just felt like the right thing to do to look after him as closely as I could today and yesterday after his surgery.  Here are some answers to some questions that I know people will ask in the comments: Mr. Marbles is a 10 year old senior chihuahua who weighs around 4.3 pounds.  It is very common in not only chihuahuas but of many toy dog breeds to have dental issues, this is due to their teeth being very small, crowed in their mouth, and when food particles get stuck in there it can lead to tartar, plaque, gingivitis, periodontal disease, all kinds of complications in their mouths just like humans.  It can also  vary in severity from dog to dog, some might have many teeth at an advanced age and some start needing dental work at 1 or 2 years old.  I tried for many years to take as many preventative steps as possible like cleaning his teeth with a small brush and with wipes, making sure he has things to chew to keep his gums and teeth clean, but it was sort of just inevitable at some point.  He has had many operations to remove teeth to keep any dental diseases from progressing and keep his mouth healthy.  The reason we needed to see a specialist (and shout out to the woman that did his procedure her name is also Jenna and she was just best ever) is because unlike larger dogs (or people) small dogs' teeth are so little and delicate in the back that in some instances their jaw can actually break during these procedures.  So as you can imagine, along with having some pretty awful levels of discomfort (he was doing a lot of sniffling as well because it was bothering his nose) this was kind of an intense procedure for him and the recovery has been pretty different than the other times when he's just had some teeth pulled.  I'm very happy though that we were able to get these last teeth out for him before things progressed any further in his mouth that would only lead to more problems for him so my guy is toothless.  Thanks for understanding that this has been a little bit of a different week.  I also just out of pure transparency wanted to tell those of you who so kindly and generously donated to my friend Mac Declue's gofundme 4 years ago, he was my roommate when I lived in Boston, a wonderful friend of mine who actually was the one who gave Mr. Marbles his name while we lived together, thank you from the bottom of my heart again for doing that and allowing him to get the absolute best treatment he could and allow his family to be by his side.  His battle with glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer, ended this past Sunday and he is finally at rest.  It has been a heartbreaking week, I'm sure you can relate as I imagine many of you have lost loved ones to cancer, and it has made taking care of Mr. Marbles, a dog that he named, a whole mix of emotions for me.  Mac was so loved and he will be so missed.   I apologize that this is not something that would usually warrant an entire video but, it's been a lot.  Thank you for your understanding and I'll see you next week.  Please subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

Below are all the links to the videos that I watched in this video, if you like any of them check out the actual video itself so they can maybe get a view, I edited most of these down so I could have a video that wasn't like an entire day long but also not to ruin the full surprise of these masterpieces which are best enjoyed in their entirety.

Thrift Store Roulette,"Oct 11, 2018",236807,963,5994111,"I hope you enjoyed this, like I said we've had a tough week with Marbles.  He's been skipping meals here and there and then yesterday he didn't eat his breakfast or dinner, making it over a full 24 hours without eating, so this morning I decided if he wouldn't eat his breakfast it's time to go in to the vet which is where we were for a large portion of the day.  It's pretty dangerous for such a little guy to eat nothing for that long (he weighed 4.8 pounds today omg so little who shrunk you).  We are getting the results back from his blood work soon, they've already ruled out pancreatitis and anything physical in his tummy like an obstruction, but senior dogs can suffer from things like kidney disease cancer etc. and it's just good to be safe here and take care of my little guy so I do apologize that this probably isn't the most exciting video you've ever seen, and LISTEN TO ME ALL PEOPLE THAT WANT TO MAKE YOUTUBE VIDEOS filming editing and uploading all in one day sometimes is a super fun plan because it forces you to make fun things on a regular basis but sometimes you need to take your tiny furry friends for an emergency day long vet trip and makes for a very bad time.  So hopefully you can understand that sometimes I just have to deal with real life and make a low key video with my super sexy space cowboy boyfriend to cheer ourselves up.  Also I am very please with my lash perm and highly recommend one to anyone that's interested but seriously just pay someone to do it.  It's a nightmare to do yourself mine came out ASS crooked and they're up so high I literally can't put on a strip lash if I wanted to lol.  But they are so permed and curly it's honestly amazing.  But anyways I'll see you next week, and if you're looking for more content we have over 200 episodes of the JennaJulien Podcast and we stream live on twitch most nights at twitch.tv/JennaJulien (heads up though if you come over there it's only Julien on camera and I'm on a LAN PC set up next to him) the chat is very sweet and fun and funny and like to laugh we like friends.  Also Julien has a vlog channel if you want to see more of him and many videos of Kermit being a Nastiboi.  Alright see you next week bye Please subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

The ""perfect foundationt trick"" is really in the ""foundation contouring""...it's what makes the skin look perfect, slenderizes your face, brings out your features and makes you look alive and glowy!So here is the foundation I've been obsessed with because it makes my skin look perfect! It is full coverage and gives your skin the perfect dewy glow that you can then set with powder.All you need is 2-3 foundation shades...Your first shade should be the lightest foundation that matched the skin at your jawline.The second foundation shade should be 2 to even 4 shades darker than the light shade.And if you use a third shade like me, it can be a color right in between the darkest foundation and the lightest.Apply foundation in a dabbing motion to get the most coverage. I like a VERY FULL COVERAGE FOUNDATION, myself! I want my foundation to look like I have perfect doll skin!I am going to show you how to apply foundation, the way that I put my foundation on every day. Some come to not only HOW TO PUT FOUNDATION ON, but HOW TO CONTOUR WITH YOUR FOUNDATION LIKE A PRO MAKEUP ARTIST!MAKEUP I USED:FOUNDATION: Beyond Perfecting Foundation + Concealer:https://www.clinique.com/product/1599...erfecting-foundation-concealer#/shade/0-5-BreezeFACE POWDER: Laura Mercier Loose Translucent PowderBOTH APPLIED WITH A BEAUTY BLENDER"
"HOW TO CONTOUR ""THE PERFECT (CELESTIAL) NOSE"" TUTORIAL","Mar 12, 2018",11115,201,961751,"Hi Guys! Today I'm showing you how to contour the ""perfect"" nose.

I'm going to teach you how to get this nose with makeup and not plastic surgery. I've used this nose contouring technique and any and every nose shape and it changes everyone's nose, no matter what their natural nose looks like. This differs than many of the ""nose contouring"" you see on instagram which can come off looking a bit weird and unnatural in real life. So from a girl who's always not liked her nose and has been contouring it since high school and then became a makeup artist and contoured hundreds of noses, may I present, ""how to contour the ""PERFECT"" nose!And I want to let everyone no, that I've never met a person that likes their nose. It seems to be that no one is happy with the shape of their nose! So I hope these ""nose contouring"" tips help someone love their nose a little more! Hee Hee HeeProducts I use for NOSE CONTOURING:1.ANY MAKE-UP BRUSH THAT IS THIN AND FLAT. YOU CAN USE AN ANGLES BRUSH AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A BRUSH THAT IS SLIGHTLY FLUFFIER TO HELP YOU BLEND.2. I ALWAYS USE A BEAUTY BLENDER TO SOFTEN AND APLLY POWDER ON TOP3. LOOSE TRANSLUCENT POWDER TO SOFTEN, DIFFUSE AND BLEND THE CONTOURING TO MAKE IT LOOK SEEMLESS WITH YOUR FACE4. BRONZER OR EYESHADOW:IF YOU ARE FAIR TO MEDIUM SKIN TONE YOU CAN USE ""HOOLA BRONZER FROM BENEFIT"" - I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT TO ORANGEY AND IT'S MATTE.FOR EYESHADOW I LOVE THE VISEART BASIC 001 PALETTE- IT HAS A GREAT RANGE OF COLORS TO MATCH MOST SKIN TONES FOR SHADING AND CONTOURING.5. CREAMS- IF I APPLY CONTOURING IN CREAM BEFORE THE POWDER STEPS (I WILL ALWYAS REPEAT THE POWDER CONTOURING STEPS I SHOWED YOU HERE THOUGH ON TOP OF THE FINISHED FOUNDATION AFTER IT'S BEEN POWDERED)I USE THE RCMA VK (FOR MEDIUM TO DARKER SKIN TONES) AND SHIINTO FOR FAIR TO MEDIUM SKIN TONES) - THEIR COLOR RANGES ARE THE BEST AND ARE DESIGNED FOR HD TV AND FILM.DISCLAIMER: I was paid by no one, no nose, no contour, no makeup brand, not even a nose hair, to make this video."

I was driving down the street in Hollywood a couple days ago and saw a billboard for magnetic eyelashes. Magnetic lashes are a little tricky to apply, but after playing around with them and wearing them the last few months, figuring out the best ways to apply the lashes and talking with the creators on One Two Cosmetics lashes that gave me some extra tips - I present HOW TO APPLY MAGNETIC EYELASHES LIKE A PRO! Proooooo! Proooooooooooooo!I personally like the BOLD style from One Two Cosmetics the most. They are the easiest for me to put on and they are just the style lash (demi wispie) that I love. It's not a full strip lash, it's just like an ""outter corner"" lash strip!DISCLAIMER: This video is totally sponsored by One Two Cosmetics, who sent me every pair of lash they make, incuding the lash applicator. However, just organically, naturally, all on my own, without ever knowing who they were, I ordered them and bought a pair of the BOLD lashes myself, along with many other TERRIBLE false lashes, to make a video TESTING & TRYING OUT MAGNETIC lashes. I wanted to test them out to tell you all what I thought...and the others were literally a joke and the only ones I liked were the One Two Cosmetics lashes."

And I wanted to give you guys a little life update to let you in on what's happening. As you guys know my health has been a little weird and concerning because of my heart. I finally, after years now of meaning to go, went to the Hansa Center, where my sister went for her Lyme Disease. They treat many chronic illnesses and many different health issues there. It is an incredible place and I was so excited to get to go, to really find out what was wrong with my heart and my body. I always put myself last and haven't taken good care of me, so I was proud of myself for going. I found out some other things once I got there that were concerning, going on once I got there. I will be better, I am better and I am going to keep getting better. My body had a chain reaction in some areas of things going wrong and taxing other organs in my body. I am going to change things in how I eat, I am trying to only eat as much gluten-free things as I can. And I'm trying to avoid dairy due to the way it slows down the lymphatic system when I need that to be operating really well. I want to thank all of you who have supported and sent me encouraging words and prayers...it has meant a lot to me. And I thank you for loving me and for caring about me.I know some of you may be wondering about the center I mentioned. If any of you are suffering from a chronic illness and want information on the Hansa Center here's their website: http://hansacenter.com/All of the dr's there are just amazing. I can't say enough things about them. I know this is not my usual video, but I just wanted to share with you guys a little about what has been going on and why I've been able to upload. I've had to take care of myself and I still have to do things every day to take care of myself. But I will do it and I want to get stronger. I won't bombard you guys with all things I'm doing and I wasn't even sure I wanted to make a video about this, but I hope this inspires, encourages and helps someone to maybe take care of themselves too!I love you guys!

6 THINGS YOU MIGHT NOT BE DOING FOR PERFECT MAKEUP | KANDEE JOHNSON,"Apr 7, 2017",19822,423,386751,"HI GUYS! Here are 6 things you might be doing wrong, or not even doing at all before you put your makeup on! And these 6 things will help give you flawless, plump, perfect, baby like skin! MAKE SURE TO SUBSCRIBE TO ME HERE SO YOU DON'T MISS OUT ON A VIDEO ➜ http://bit.ly/1GoV9M8 Everyday people put their makeup on, and might be skipping some important ""beauty tips"" and makeup artist pro tips, to get the most perfect, flawless skin. You have to prime your ""face"" canvas, before putting your makeup on. I'm going to show you the 6 things to do before putting you makeup on to help you get the most amazing looking skin and makeup!QUICK STEPS:1. Make sure you wash your hands after you've touched your cell phone and before you touch your face so you don't transfer any bacteria that can turn into blemishes or breakouts.2. Wash your face- unless you've just gotten out of shower, you'll want to wash the oil, dirt and sweat off your skin. If you apply makeup on to skin that hasn't been properly cleansed you can trap any bacteria down into the pores where breakouts, blackheads and whiteheads will begin to grow.3.Exfoliate your skin, this will slough off dead skin cells and thoroughly clean your skin and pores for the softest, clearest skin.4. Use Hyaluronic Acid to plump up the skin. Hyaluronic acid is one of the most powerful properties for anti-aging in the skin. It holds water and plumps up the skin, fine lines and wrinkles.5. Moisturize - this is one of the most important steps for flawless skin and to combat signs of aging and fine lines and wrinkles. Moisturizer plumps up the skin and makes the makeup go on so much smoother over hydrated skin. (Price for Dramatically Different Moisturizer - tube $14.50 and pump is $26.50) Make sure to apply lip balm to hydrate your lips too!6. Clean your makeup sponge, beauty blender and makeup brushes. All of your makeup tools can harbor bacteria as well as spreading unwanted pigment.WHAT I USED:CLEANSER - Mad Hippie Cleanser: http://bit.ly/2nKFfs7EXFOLIATOR - Tarte Frixxxtion Stick: http://bit.ly/2oQ5ijnHYALURONIC ACID: Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud: http://bit.ly/2nKG6c0MOISTURIZER: Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturing LotionBRUSH CLEANER: Beauty So Clean: http://bit.ly/2o9ENXz💜💙💚💛💖COME BE MY BFF EVERYWHERE💜💙💚💛💖💛INSTAGRAM ➜ http://www.instagram.com/kandeejohnson💙TWITTER ➜ http://www.twitter.com/kandeejohnson💛SNAPCHAT ➜ KandeeJohnson💙FACEBOOK ➜ http://www.facebook.com/kandeejohnsonMY VLOG CHANNEL ➜ http://www.youtube.com/kandeeland➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ 💛➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ COME SEE MY LAST 3 VIDEOS:9 DIY NAIL POLISH HACKS: http://bit.ly/2nkHeYJHOW I DID MY HIGH SCHOOL MAKEUP: http://bit.ly/2oPTNIBDIY T-SHIRT CUTTING: http://bit.ly/2nRKfMk💄➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜  WATCH  SOME OF MY BEST MAKEUP TUTORIALS HERE: 🎨HOW TO CONTOUR LIKE A CONTOUR ARTIST: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uSG7...✔HOW TO GET PERFECT BROWS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ8JD...💋HOW TO FAKE LIP INJECTIONS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsT0f...🍋SKIN DOCTOR: LEMON TRICK VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vkCR...😀HOW TO GET REALLY WHITE TEETH FOR CHEAP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_M5M...💜➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ FUN MAKEUP TRANSFORMATION VIDEOS➜ ➜ ➜ 💜BARBIE DOLL TRANSFORMATION: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_IfR...CARTOON HALF MAN - HALF WOMAN TRANSFORMATION: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLTGE...ELSA FROZEN TRANSFORMATION: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=797go...EVERYDAY DISNEY PRINCESS MAKEUP SERIES:http://bit.ly/1z5yoc2BETTY BOOP TRANSFORMATION: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liKWO...➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ HAIR TUTORIALS➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ MY HAIR TUTORIAL PLAYLIST: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ YOUTUBER TRANSFORMATIONS➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ TURNING MYSELF INTO OTHER YOUTUBERS: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHECK OUT MY NAIL POLISH COLLECTION WITH SINFUL NAILS HERE: http://www.sinfulcolors.com/kandeeDISCLAIMER: No one paid me to like any of these products.

Affordable Holiday Gift Guide: $35 and Under | Ingrid Nilsen,"Nov 30, 2018",5241,143,44591,"There are SO many gift options to choose from right now and it can definitely get overwhelming trying to figure out what to get while also honoring your budget. In my experience, I’ve found that “affordable gift guide” lists often feature items that are random and don’t feel personal. To make this process a little easier for you, I put together a selection of unique, thoughtful and sustainable gifts that are all $35 and under. I’ve had first-hand experience with all of these recommendations, so I *know* they’re awesome and stand the test of time. It can be easy to get caught up in the allure of fancy presents (I’ve been there!), but if there’s one thing I’ve learned over the years it’s that giving a great gift isn’t about the money you spend, it’s about the time and care you put into it. I hope this guide inspires you with ideas for the people in your life, but most of all, I hope it reminds you that you don’t need a lot to make someone feel seen, appreciated and loved. P.S.

What's In My Bathroom Cabinet? | Ingrid Nilsen,"Nov 16, 2018",5148,86,159959,"Welcome to my bathroom! These are all the skincare and hair products I’m currently using / transitioning into for fall and winter. You’ll notice lots of old favorites from over the years, new ones and a few things I’ve never tried before. Also, a quick FYI: If you watched my video last week, then you know that I’ve adopted new practices to become more mindful about my shopping habits. In many ways, the changes I’ve made when it comes to shopping for clothes stemmed from how I buy/use my beauty products. I like to finish products before moving into new ones, as you’ve been able to see from my annual empties videos over the last two years. Since part of my job consists of trying different beauty products, there are a couple things to note: 1. I’m in a position where I receive more gifted items than I can use. I’m very mindful about what I choose to keep to make sure they’re things I’ll realistically be using. Everything else is given to friends or donated to a local women’s shelter. 2. I want to help people make informed decisions about their purchases and I believe the only way to truly do that is to purchase products myself. I want to understand what I’m willing to spend my money on, what I’m willing to repurchase and what’s just not worth it. For me, all of this is about being thoughtful and creating a balance that allows me to do my job (something I continue to love) without being excessively wasteful. The more I’ve practiced this, the more I’ve learned. That is my ultimate happy place.️----------WEEKLY UPDATE: OMG I’M IN PARIS aka one of my favorite cities in the world! It’s always so surreal being here and it’s even more unbelievable to be here working on something very special. Right now, I can’t say much about it, but I’m SO excited and I’ll share more details with you when I can. GOSH, I just fall in love with this place more and more every time I visit.

Why I (Almost Completely) Stopped Shopping | Ingrid Nilsen,"Nov 9, 2018",14861,269,117944,"2019 will mark 10 years on YouTube for me and over those years, I’ve made A LOT of videos. Specifically, A LOT of hauls/shopping related videos. 2019 will also be the year I turn 30, something I view as a pretty significant personal milestone. As I’ve reflected on the past, I’ve been able to see how old habits no longer serve me and I’ve become more curious about the habits that do. This year, I decided to almost completely stop shopping. The older I get, the more I care about how my actions affect other people, the world and my own personal well-being. The fashion industry is wasteful (that’s no secret) and it also has a complex consumerist power over us that keeps us wanting more. I love beautiful things but I don’t want my life to be ruled by them. I want the things that I own to be reflections of myself, not the other way around. I want to present and express myself in a way that makes me feel like *me* without obsession or pressure. I want to dedicate my headspace to the work and people I care about. If you’re reading this, you are part of that group. I never, ever imagined that I would have a career that allows me to even think about these things, let alone pursue them and I know it’s a profound privilege. I started making videos because watching YouTube helped me survive some of the most painful years of my life. I keep making videos because the healing I’ve found is meant to be shared.❤️Article mentioned: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/op...----------I’m in the process of slowly decorating and putting my place together.

"How to Do a Self Breast Exam, According to a Pro | Ingrid Nilsen","Oct 31, 2018",3819,75,721544,"We’re all told we should be doing self breast exams, but the reality is that most of us end up with tons of questions swirling in our heads when we attempt to do one. Things like: Am I doing this right? What should I be looking for? How often should I be doing this? I feel lots of stuff in there! Is that normal? Okay, I think I found something. Now what? Should I be concerned? If I’m being completely honest, self breast exams have always scared me. I’m afraid of doing it wrong and missing something. I’m afraid of doing it right and finding something. That’s why I’ve made this video. My goal is to take the mystery and fear out of the process by providing simple, easy to follow steps and tips from a pro. Jennifer Hankins, a Provider with One Medical will be guiding us through the self exam steps and answering questions that most of have, but sometimes are afraid to ask. Body awareness is the most important part of self breast care.  Knowing your body and recognizing changes outside of a scheduled monthly self check is appropriate for many women.  You can always talk to your healthcare provider to see what's best for you.Think of this as the ultimate form of self-care and connection. ️❤️I’m doing #selfexamsunday this weekend! If you want to join, post a selfie after you do a self exam and I’ll share them in my IG stories. Make sure to use the hashtag #selfexamsunday and tag @ingridnilsen so I can find it! I'm not affiliated with One Medical in any way other than being a happy patient. I've paid for and used their service for the last year and it has been the easiest, most streamlined, ENJOYABLE medical care experience I've ever had. They have locations across the U.S. so if you're interested in learning more, check out their website: https://www.onemedical.com OTHER VIDEOS IN MY BREASTS/BOOBS SERIES:I’m The Daughter of A Breast Cancer Survivorhttps://youtu.be/_zIAL_sHfTcHow I Stopped Hating My Small Boobshttps://youtu.be/0z03AMz3CEc----------I’m in the process of slowly decorating and putting my place together. I’ll be sharing updates in real-time on Instagram, so make sure you’re following me if you’d like to see everything! http://www.instagram.com/ingridnilsenWEEKLY UPDATE: I seriously don’t know what’s happening to TIME right now. It feels like every week is just flying by! My friend Carrie has been visiting from LA for the last few days and it has been so wonderful having her here. I’ve forgotten how much I love having friends stay over at my place, but after two consecutive weeks of visits, I have officially been reminded! I have to say that since being in NYC, I have been so much more social. It definitely isn’t about proximity because most of my close friends live in LA. So what is it then? I think it’s a lot of things, but it all stems from one big thing: New York is the place where I have always wanted to live. Yes, it’s a hectic city but I feel so at peace here. I’ve kind of broken all the standard “rules” you hear about, like New Yorkers not cooking. I’ve cooked the vast majority of my meals here, including meals with other people. I’m learning how to make this MY New York, not the New York you read about or see in movies. I think that’s it. I’ve found love here and it has made me more daring, more free and more open. All the best love I know has felt that way, but it has never come from a place before. It’s a feeling I’m drinking in and gosh, I’m grateful for it. ️----------OTHER PLACES TO FIND ME:Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ingridnilsen Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ingridnilsenFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/heyingridnilsen----------MISSED MY LAST VIDEO?
