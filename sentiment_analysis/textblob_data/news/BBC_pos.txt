Biden
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
joe does n't need luck to win in 2020
apparently this is his fourth attempt
the second one is excluded by those friendly to him because he dropped out over plagiarism charges
america has clearly made itself clear that it no longer supports establishment politics whether on the left or right so whoever wins will not be biden
he 's exactly the opposite of what i want in a candidate
can i please support bbc more than just paying tv licence
looks like he ’ s had a bit of plastic surgery to make himself look more presidential
i bet the bbc won ’ t smear him though as he has the ‘ right kind of politics ’
like his quote about obama i mean you got the first mainstream african-american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy
the first 'clean african american
i 'm sure booker t washington among others bathed
nobody wants that old relic with 1960 ’ s thinking in the wh
i hope creepy joe biden wins the democrat nomination as he 'll be handing president trump four more years
its obvious who the establishment wants
scotland the brave
democrats have so many people throwing their hat in
they 're going to have to flip a coin and have the super delegates decide who gets to run against trump
this is going to be a lot of fun to watch
if he did become president we can look forward to the elimination of usn and british warships doing freedom of navigation exercises in the south china sea and acquiescence by biden of china 's right to build islands in international waters
ca n't see this schmuck winning against trump
bernie sounds the most genuine with his policies the rest are fooling the people
that creep could n't swat a fly let alone punch anybody
that 's why in order to fulfill his sexual desires on women and children he smells and caresses them
he might win the popular vote best case and lose the electoral college
good luck joe 3 might be your lucky number
third time is a trip to gitmo in the near future
biden 's still better than trump
active trumpers i see d
wow
lol
old and older are running for the office
trump already win 2020
good
first
you 'll also have to be able explain what you 'd done with the no past president for the last 8 long years
just a friendly reminder
strong borders
strong nations
pres trump 2020 win will be historically epic
not a single one
the charlottesville police did nothing to hinder the left-wing anti-fa from assaulting the right-wing marchers or even try to shield/protest the lawful and peaceful marchers
i hope andrew yang wins
these old geezers need to retire
wow the bbc is desparate
bbc wants anybody any lowlifer as long as it 's not trump
this guy has no chance hell the democrats ai n't got no chance there whole candidate set this time is clowns
he wont win
im glad more people are seeing how creepy he is
old uncle joe should won the second time in 2008
paedophile biden more skeletons in his closet than tony blair paedo joe would give harvey weinstein a run for his money
it 's quite clear that the democrats have already made that decision for them
hahahahaha as if
biden it 's fine
bernie joe you do know we could buy a new car with money left over for what all that is costing us right
bernie so are we that 's why we should get a new car now so our kids have something dependable to rely on once we go
lol a threat to himself
this man should go and have a rest let them give the young ones a chance to run for president
andrew yang and bernie as vp are the best choices
not creepy joe biden no no no no
i want to be like creepy joe when i get old and be happy with young girls
for creepy joe wo n't win in 2020 because he will not be able to get black men to the voting polls because what he did to black american men in 1990 we will never forget what he did to out community so go to hell you creepy old man
great fluff piece
to be fair i like him more than hillary
the united states is a plutocracy with an elaborate window dressed simulation of democracy used to deceive its people
bernie sanders is leading in all poles that are real
the only qualification needed is not being donald trump voting him out is the whole point
i heard military guards will be at every voting booth in america to make sure no illegal aliens vote and the democrats can not cheat the election
name one piece of meaningful legislation he has gotten past
hiding how many people showed up in the pittsburgh rally is not a good sign of truthfulness openness
i think trump will win again
liberal policies never ever worked in the real world
lets make america even greater with trump
conflict of interests is clearly stamped on his forehead
he is very racist and naci
i believe what joe biden said here and i really do n't like tromp one simple example is wall
he may be leading in polls for now but i know sooner or later americans will realize that they deserve better
lol not a chance once the ukraine and china crimes come out very surprised he even put his hat in they are going to eat his lunch and dinner as well what a can of worms
do n't worry about it because donald trump will win agen
dear joe take my advice instead of running again for president why do you not embrace your more natural talent and start a massage parlor where you can exercise your hands by giving people full body head massages
hugs and kisses complimentary
the time when his wife/daughter died and son died was many years dont say then his son died 43 years actually
and for the party who hates old white guys he seems pretty old and white to me
lmao
anyone in democrat ’ s would be better than bone spur
it ’ s time for all this old people to take a rest it looks like america is having problems some one to run for president
joe always shows the kind gestures that can be used to identify high level sociopaths.therefore joe will always be a well balanced individual who creates the right decisions at an opportune time
joe biden the stereo typical elitist american the guys got footage of him touching up females of all ages all over youtube the guys a creep
obama is the first articulate clean black
free assange
most people in the democrat party know joe biden is a paedophile
this news is a week old bbc
oh that ’ s right they ’ re trying to brainwash us
hahahaha
who is supporting illhan omar hit like
go home biden move over for the youth you old creep
joe biden is the same old vomitted-up mushroom gravy which has taken us to near-extinction
the paedo bbc 's favorite slimebag
trump is gon na win again so dems are wasting their time and corporation bribe money
hahaha
brilliant the bbc backing a creepy pervy pedo hmmm i never thought they would do that
the bbc love paedophiles
i love me some joe biden
intelligent people vote donald trump
he paws women and children and on top of that he is too old
bbc is a joke they want joe biden to be president which will never happen god of usa is jesus not other gods.i mean god of abhraham issac and jacob i agree that there is plenty of other gods as well since this country is founded on principle of christ jesus can not ignore the cry of his beloved ones.mighty jesus will not allow that its very simple logic when god is with us who can stand against its warning period for usa i mean till2024 till then good bye for joebiden and co
nope old candidate check out andrew yang you will be surprised thanks 👍
no one wants another obama or hillary
am i the only one who finds the music to be bizarrely loud
ugh no thanks
maybe he thinks this was just a simple mistake but it 's amazing that you can be responsible for mass murder and still have the audacity to run for president
the pervert swims naked in front of all his security men and women lmao
watching him go down in flames is going to be so much fun to watch lol damn this is going to be making america great again
nah trumps good he may be a bit racist but you no he 's done more for the country then anyone
go mr bidden you will be better then what is in there now
i am sorry has a trucker for the lost of your family but use their love for you and put it into winning in 2020 canada great britian australia and the rest of the world loved you well you made history with mr obama when he became the first african president and made hateful people have to bite their tongue
it was the best 8 years since regan carter abraham lincoln was in the office
and then when he shows up they elect him president of the united states
i 'd vote for joe any day over trump at least he 's not a liar and a gritter and will bring more stability and dignity to the office
make america great again long live america the most beautiful and powerful country in the world
the only dem candidate pulling over large amounts of trump people
the candidate with more policies that would kick start the second renaissance
the only group i see with as much energy as obama in 2008
we have a 3rd timer candidate for president and she didnt win and she died shortly after

happy birthday to him
famous people disappoint me the very few that put a smile on my face will always be diana 's good looking and graceful sons this is why diana is loved so much she was n't just a princess but she was also a great mother
humble people with a big heart will always be remembered and loved and when they die they become legends there story will always be told
they live in a country where the police come over to check a person 's thinking if they like a certain tweet and this is what 's important
look i 'm all for the best wishes when any couple welcomes a newborn
and ceremonial institutions are the glue of a culture yada yada but this time its going to take more than obsession over celebrities to halt the looming orwellian darkness

congratulations to both of you baby boy great news prince harry
ok ya diré continuará grc grc grc ave maria jose
why did megger markles make up artist fly to england is he trying to work wonders on the much used in past fanny
d rated actress in usa make up is n't really needed but for some one who has been around the block several times not only divorced woman but she dumped her last boyfriend just before she got friend to introduce her to henry of wales..a ginger red head
awesome
hope he has more
one more freeloader taxpayers have to maintain for the rest of his life 😒😒😒
happy wishes
the way he said it was absolutely lovely and so respectful
they should name their new son edward woodstock after the black prince who was england 's most famous knight in the fourteenth century
awww
prince harry looks so happy
lets hope the baby looks like a brother and not a white michael jackson lol
all those right wing nuts are gon na be crying in their beers lol
aww this made me tear up a little
so sweet
good now expose the royal family for same crimes scandals injustices as the vatican coverup bbc
i 'm sure the baby will be fine if they do n't change his sex in the next few years like they did with dianna david
they all should be stripped of their titles and wealth to be made to live like the rest of us
yes women are strong enough to bring our babies into this world
i am glad for you you will have such a grand time playing again
just another one that will live off tax payers money
big weddings.castles.flash hoildays its great
oh he 's so happy and so in love
he 'll be a great dad a fun dad full of pranks and playfulness
camilla looks happy on the background
and just after louis first and charlotte fourth
great another name to add to the royal family and i should care cuz
why not report on declining animal species/climate change instead the future of the new baby might not be great
that ’ s exactly what we did
they were even polite enough to stay away when our daughter married and our granddaughter was born at our private home with no interference from the press whatsoever
in fact when we asked the bbc if they would like to photograph the baby they kindly said they couldn ’ t give a shit
easy
long live the nationalist republic of great britain
why do you keep banging on about her needing a cesarian when they never planned on having a natural birth in the first place
she is a good partner and a beautiful woman barbados
meghan is so gorgeous i bet the baby is too
congratulations a million time and may god and all the good will of the whole world good people prevail for ever and those evils of the her families and the lies sabres rattling eat their venomous dungs hourrrrray to d meghan and the gallant prince hurry and the queens and all yapapppppa dabaaaaa dooioo hourrrrrrrrrrrry to the good of all good peoples
grandad hewitt will be proud
i haven ’ t been interested in the last 3 royal babies slow news day
what a sweet man he has become he ’ s come so far from that trouble-making ginger i used to read about when i was a kid
i ’ m sure james hewitt is a very proud grandpa
she also loves and tends to be very close to megan to a point of cracking jokes with her
anyway congrats once again anf may the almighty bless your beautiful family
as soon as i saw this i screamed from excitement we have all waited so long i ’ m so happy for the family
i still see him as a baby beautiful boy
welcome to the jungle
name him ramadan as he born in the beginning of the blessed month of ramadan
i do n't know why any individual should care about these kind of stuff especially if it 's from the very country that used to enslave our own but seeing as me being a reporter and it 's my duty to report i guess i 'll just go ahead and report
a real news report today from sri lanka
so what thousands of babies are born across the world everyday why is his one anymore special
congratulations duke and duchess of sussex for your first royal baby boy
i wish you all the best harry and meghan with your beautiful bundle of joy
she 'd be so proud of her sons and ❤ both kate and meghan.😊
may the almighty god preserve our new prince and usher him to his original destiny
congratulations to this man he seems a really nice guy but can ’ t stand anything his family stand for

parasite gives birth to another parasite british monarch head of state of arguably the most murderous nation in the history of the world britain murderer of irish indians indigenous australians native americans kenyans malayans and much more recently northern irish catholics iraqis libyans syrians

love from 🇮🇳
a new heir to the iron throne
long live prince boris
dont be deceived by the so called royals they certainly aint what you think they are
i think it would be cool if they named him spencer it would be a huge 'nod to harry 's mother
harry is so cool
happy for him and his wife
the best royal ever
how totally brilliant
i love harry and i 'm so happy hes found meghan and has his first baby and is so happy and clearly adores his family
congratulations 🎉🎊✨ it 's nice to have some good news for a change 🎈🎈🎉
those children haven ’ t had nearly as much media coverage than this one pregnancy/baby has had and will have
one more member of robber family
beautiful diana is looking down with a smile
he is so excited
happy for them
congrats man👍💪🤗 wish good health conditions for them
another scrounger who will no doubt enjoy shooting animals and torturing children just like grandma does
i really do n't care about this couple but for the love of god do n't bully and insult a baby who is literally out in the world for less than 24hrs
you 're going to be great parents
congratulations on your baby boy lots of love health and joy for all of you
i 'm so happy for them
congratulations 🍾🎊🎈🎉 so happy for the little brit half american prince 👑

best wishes to all of them ♥
i couldn ’ t be happier for you and i am so proud for both yourself and meghan
so happy for the royals
wow
for a peep at who 's pulling the wool over who 's eyes..james corbett 's ww1 documentary trilogy does brilliantly
prince harry discovered women are superior
wow he finally grew up
british tax payers must be thrilled
one more mouth for the uk payer to feed
one more cruel heartless white joined the world
one more oppressor arrived
all nurses are alive and well
on reflection i do n't believe this baby was born today hence the secrecy this baby was born sometime ago and the photo release will be digitally altered she was pregnant before she got married the things the royal will do to save any embarrassment
congrats to whole royal family and god bless the new born prince a gr8 health
awww bless him so hard
wish your wife has a simple and easy delivery and your son has a healthy life
heartbreaking to know the real reason she 's had this baby with harry and why she married him purely for self gain
we love you🙏🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🙏the best news
if diana could see him now she would have been so proud
in so happy for them
the most perfect name on earth
that is one loud plane ngl
captain james hewitt must be so happy that he has a grandson think about it
she was n't even pregnant
cavalry officer james hewitt got very possibly now a grandson lol
but wait you live in the uk
how dare you impose your gender roles on that poor innocent child
i think her father ’ s adorable
congratulation you are the real prince because you did not hasitate to marry a girl from black race
best of wishes 2 the royal family
thats magic news well done congratulations🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳😉😉🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
how can you be a prince today while innocent people have become uk 's political prisoners freeassange
good evening people all around the world
surely if it disconnects
they know your name your entire family where they you live
procedure if somebody or many people camera your brain
if you hear somebody or many voices are talking to you inside your head you 're not crazy
somebody or many people connected their brain to your brain through secret high tech device from afar
brain camera is already been bought by many secret buyers all around the world
book of daniel many shall run fro knowledge/intelligence of mankind shall increased in time of the end which is our time
say in the light
they are very wise vigilant
be wise vigilant prayerful to god always
pray first before asking help anything else
pray first always
that duznt look like the real harry did anybody else c him shapeshift at the beginning and the horse reacted at exact same time
thank goodness meghan does not have to hold her tummy anymore lol
congrats you guys are so deserving and wonderful human being
we have had a baby would have been more appropriate.❤️
best wishes
i 'm sure generations of kings are rolling in their graves
i 'm glad diana did n't get to see this atrocity
so adorable
i 'm crying happily 😄😄😄
thats quick
one more oppressor arrived
i like that that he said 'baby boy like there also could have been 'adult woman
very happy for both of you
the baby boy of prince harry is mixed race viva the little son of the late beautiful princess diana
that ’ s the only interest i have in this lmao seeing what it looks like
she 's a pure dramaqueen all about her
she sure was huge to have such a little baby
and no i do n't think his mom would be very proud of his choice she would have put the actress in her place long ago
to many movie star/celebraty interference
enjoy life or born babies or something else
by the way prince harry is a gay so why he married

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Notre Dame
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
did the real life movie happen
that 's the important thing everything else is replaceable
there 's a complete media blackout in the uk at the moment about the real situation of
censorship is very fierce even some journalists
many thanks god bless
it was such a beautiful church
please don ’ t let the secularists led by macron near this priceless holy house of god
this the real life ending of the hunchback of notre dame movie frollo burned it all down
to the big bells as loud as the thunder
let ’ s just hope this is a small part of the landmarks legacy and the building will make full recovery🙏
amazing work
we all know it can be fixed but it will never be the same
i ’ m sure this has nothing to do with the other churches in france that were vandalized
nice job
the fire of the notre dame cathedral is symbolic as the destruction of the wtc in n.y but fortunately without human sacrifices
this is depressing to me a beautiful building structure that we lost our ancestors will be disappointed to us for this to happen such beautiful building structure 😔
it 's a real tragedy that the building that more or less watched over a country for decades has suffered such damage
on the bright side the structure itself
was mostly intact thanks to the collective efforts of all those who put out the fires
finally a church became the light in the dark
rip beautiful piece of history art and architecture
the whole cultural world is mourning not only paris
amazing architecture and a shame it 's damaged for that reason
the new earth and times for new beginnings
got to make sure all candles are fully snuffed
but gosh our esteemed cinc made such a breathtaking and helpful observation for the french huh
the devil is a great liar
the greatest liar on earth
destruction by nature or by any other cause is easy than construction
hope they rebuild with steel for the new roof so this might never happen again
where are the people gathering for him on these fine holy week days
i hope quazimodo is okay
i hope much damage has not been done
new investment project
it is more than just a historical monument
absolute tragedy
best coverage thanks
i can´t understand why that kind of cultural historical treasures like notre dame in paris france isn´t protected with modern sprinkler systems and sensitive smoke and fire alarm systems which would make that kind of massive disastrous fires impossible or at least fast and easy to extinguish before serious large scale structural damages
my heart goes out to you anyone who feels the loss as deeply or more than i
ahh thats hot thats hot
good job 👍 1 million dollar donation to repair this building but no money for homeless people
very smart
honestly this is truly heart breaking
i never visited notre dame but i imagine my great great great great grandparents likely visited before moving to america
ive never left my country never seen anything else except st cathrines ive missed so much
it stood for over 800 years took 200 to build and is the work so many dedicated believers
we can not begin to imagine how many people have visited notre dame how many drew comfort from it and how many even if not catholic treasured it as a symbol of paris and the surrounding community
it was a work of art and an important piece of history
they could of put the fire out in about 5 mins no matter how big the flames with sound
think it 's a lot of hot air i tell you some might say b/s go check it out 2 young uni guys have found the frequency at which fire burns go watch it i kid you not this was the work of the illuminate..april is their month of sacrifice by fire look it up do your research you owe it to yourselves
i have nothing but complete and absolute respect for those firefighters
extremely brave and absolute heroes they are
welcome to 2019
t-t it 's so sad it was a beautiful place
the old world is crumbling
this is n't the first time that this has happened
this is quite fishy since mainstream media has been able to predict real life events years before happening in television shows and movies
such things as iconic as the simpsons and disney are bound to place hidden predictions in shows without us noticing
lol this
i ca n't wait to see my favorite medieval icon notre dame
at least the alter boys are safe now from the priests
😐 this is the building that survived hugenouts attack in the 16th century desecration during the french revolution world war 1 and world war 2 but it is also the place where mary stuart queen of scots got married as well as james v not to mention the coronation of napoleon bonaparte and the canonisation of joan of arc took place here as well as the requiem masses when degaulle died and later on mitterand that building is paris
looks like a volcanic eruption or like a bomb going off.just so very sad.such an old unique iconic architecture
good they bands our memes
something is very suspicious here
state wouldn ’ t sell church for modern renovations inside job
i 've only seen it in pictures but it was magnificent
so much for the handy work of man
typically the causes of fires are quickly deduced
i never remember an instance when flammable materials where not carefully secured at all times
i was in paris could n't visit norte dame due to limited time but outside architecture is amazing beautiful it truly reflects the people amazing creativity and attention to details
real news please stop spraying chemtrailes
one too many little boys got touched
as a muslim it saddens me that such a church is ruined a church is important as a mosque to a muslim for they are both a place where people worship the one lord
euronymous and the boys would be happy
are church bells ok
apparently everything else was covered in ash except the one thing stayed untouched the cross of jesus
waw thats great
oh well never mind would like to see architectures try to rebuild it oh wait there to dumb nowadays would never be able to do that
more space now to build a local mosque
this is heartbreaking such a beautiful building
this is epic
it was being saved by older generation even in the world war ii
in today we are as human beings fail to protect neither humanity as many wars in the world in different ways and neither their resources like this cathedral and many more around the world are being distracting
so people rise for humanity and protect of mankind from their own disaster
spread loving kindness and believe as all are from one god instead of many and respect to each other
then world will be very pleasant place to mankind and all the beings
it was the most beautiful building in paris
remember old summer palace now
however it will be rebuilt to its former glory and become a symbol of the human capacity for cultural recovery and renewal
black market manage to save more than firefighters
lovely to hear
so surreal to see history in such a way
love you guys
now support and love for each other is needed more than ever
i visited notre dame about 7 years ago a place of immense unforgetable architectural glory to me it left a greater impact than the eiffel tower or any museum it is the core art piece of paris
much love to all
le bras freres a contractor noted for their many restoration projects of cathedrals throughout europe and its skilled workers would have known better not to leave behind incendiary devices especially since the fire broke out when all the workers had left
the fire if started by a candle or a faulty electrical wiring would not have burned so fiercely and brilliantly
regardless of the 800 year old age of the building the intensity of the fire seem to be extraordinarily bright
old wood are one of the hardest material to burn
to claim that it was accidental is to divert further inquiries investigations into the true cause
certainly it seems that “ when there is smoke there is fire ” and this smoke seems to be coming not from the cathedral but back to somewhere else
love from iraq to france
vis major
what were the workers doing smoking near turpentine or paint
helping with the rebuilding of this beautiful landmark of the world
then i realized it really was just a dream
as an american i 'd rather lose several of our landmark buildings than an irreplaceable old world icon like notre-dame de paris
i ca n't think of a more revered piece of christian architecture excepting perhaps st peter 's or the hagia sophia
so many people are hating on this
the notre dame was one of the most beautiful buildings in europe it was a revolution in engineering for its time and the cost is not just physical this is a catastrophic event
and even then it shall never be the same so many people 's live quiet literally went into this building and so many of them can never be replaced
some of the wood works in there were art in themselves and they are gone forever now but ash when once they were proud pieces many stones will fall to never be raised again
our sympathies from new zealand
all the comments are just memes lmao f
might god wants that
haha wyh iz thare no poliz offisers thare to put aut the fier
the ironic and symbolic significance is staggering
future generations would not be able to see it
850 years old
she did an excellent job
she delivered the news appropriately and dressed elegantly to show sadness
most people being silent yes but believers also sang a lot of religious songs while kneeling down
it is interesting to have watched it and say i remember when the notre dame burned down just like the day of 9/11
such a beautiful and iconic historical building
let´s hope the main structure remains standing as a landmark for its cititzens to enjoy
good good
please more fire
i am so happy
i hope the hunchback is ok
if spelling is right thumbs up
however the most high does not dwell in houses made with hands acts 7:48
now i ’ ll never be able to watch the hunchback of notredame again
i love the bbc what a classy and respectful group of journalists..especially during crisis
is it true that it has alot of devil statues
great news💯👍
what about quasimodo is he ok
we lost that and we pray everything will be fine
i was sober on the way to work
i had the honour and pleasure of walking into note dame cathedral it took my breath away and i spent the next 30 minutes crying and experiencing the power of our heavenly father there in this most beautiful yet quiet place
my hats off to all those brave and wonderful firemen who risked so much to bring it under control
also bless those that were able to save the relics
france will rebuild and it will just as beautiful
the building is super old
and ww1 and ww2 happend close enough to it and it was fine
i ’ m pretty sure this building has no electric wires or anything like that how in the hell would the fire start
the building is 850 years old and its remained fine how did it catch on fire
is it real that french government asked us raise money
one of my favorite landmarks😭😭
the french government leases the grand old church for a certain fee which amounts to not one cent
to a certain church
secondly my understanding is that churches get very special tax concessions even if they do pay tax
thirdly i believe thousands upon thousands of folks visit this grand edifice daily at a fee and has for years upon years
hot dame
i believe in jesus christ still saying that jesus is coming very soon give your life to jesus he is the only way the truth and life
atleast we got a free assassins creed game out of it
this is just the first of many more to come
the media are blaming the construction company before the investigation has barely begun
the art lost alone was probably priceless
mourn the loss of an old building
one of the most iconic and legendary medieval structures burns down 2 million views
i guess the rich dont shell out until they see the tragedy in their backyard
if it 's ever restored or rebuilt it wo n't be 800 years old and its authenticity would be lost
how many christian places of worship have burnt down in the past four years
gave their lives so boldly
hope the blueprints artisans and materials are available to rebuild it
first twin towers now noted dame
free for the france
heartbreaking to see the beautiful building burning
what a lost to the world it can be rebuilt but all the history that goes along with it makes the place priceless
bless all the people of this beautiful place
i would like to get a full explanation how that fire started not all this senseless blah blah
restauration worker puts on cigarette right next to high flammable stuff
high flammable stuff immediately catches fire and everything goes up in flames
what we have lost is a great work of art that 's what is valuable and that 's what 's worth recreating
at 45 secounds into the video check the right top side of the screen and theres a cross in the smoke its white no joke really
looks like 2019 is n't the best year for history
ok but can we stop pretending the building was a person that passed away like wtf lol
the tragedy that happened this time is reported in the news a lot in japan and many people are surprised
i pray in japan from the bottom of my heart that the people in paris will return to their original form as soon as possible
sad to see the destruction of the beautiful notre dame cathedral
hopefully the french will be able to rebuild the cathedral.😢😢
rip quasimodo o
many wished it destroyed completely tough luck because stone does not burn
whoever has will be given more and they will have an abundance
internationally renown symbol of catholicism oddly catches fire during holy week👀🧐🧐🧐 suspicious much
lol
850 years old and it took 200 years to make
which makes it 1,050 years old
it will take considerable investigating to find the truth out about this
im so happy
why is this trending 1 this actuallly important this part of history getting destroyed
im happy it burned now i got a free assassins creed unity d
it 's like seeing an old friend hurt and mamed bit not being able to help
is this museum made from papers how it burn easily like this
850 years old wow
in my hometown we had that happens too next to an old house they build a mall and renovated the old house right next to the mall they just built but than for some reason the i 'm german it just forgot the word it 's the opposite of basement started to burn and than the roof was on fire but it was just a 3 story building so the firefighters did their job and only the inside had some damage on the top and few parts of the roof but that 's it
oooof such a nice work of art
on the bright side they ’ re all set for ash wednesday 2020
inside job to slowly but for surely erase religion in france
it 's was soo fun
certian status has their magic function and balance the magnetic field
why the poeple remove the status from the church i dont know if they get some advise before take the action
it really pisses me off
the disney movie but live action
watch a mosque will be built on top or nearby
i hope this will never happen again because this was one of the most important churches of the world i hope paris will get better sooner because a lot of bad things are happening in this world but god will be with us
good old thick white smoke and my oh my are those flames extremely bright
also how did they rule out arson within hours of it extinguished when it takes a significant amount of time to conduct an arson investigation
before any investigation of the real cause
maybe because it was too old then just rebuild it
flint still doesn ’ t have clean water
y ’ all have a nice day
do not just pray for fun
major historical disaster great loss
it never fails that someone will test the lord 's power
i would n't be surprised if the eiffel tower somehow collapsed
good that the flames didnt claim any life because we ca n't restore life
the end times are near
such a beautiful architecture now in flames what ashame
we should rebuild with golden roofing on top
what a beautiful sight
the first time that people actually grieved for the loss of no one except a building
if the wood was 8 hundred years old the sun can burn it easily any way we have greenhart and purplehart wood that can last forever
honestly this is the saddest thing of my entire life
that building was amazing and perfect
when the first plane arrives
this is such a historical loss i will never forget visiting this wonderful cathedral
lmao
lmao
love from utah
lmao
damn what a good time to be alive i 'm been watching a lot of things that have been going doen lately shootings internet control and a lot more
anyone else think it 's pure coincidence that an icon of christianity full of priceless art treasures goes up in flames at the start of holy week
so much publicity to fire breaking out in a church why is no one talking about masjid e aqsa fire that occured at the same time
you will go up high more building work to do what can you do
thankfully the stone outside is still standing along with the two iconic bell towers still stand
many resources will be key to rebuild
the good news in all this is that no one died in this fire while wood and stone can be replaced and even improved despite the haters
hopefully the future roof will be made if possible of non-flammable material like steel and aluminum beams including the spire and like a phoenix rising from its ashes maybe this old cathedral could become better than ever as a model for environment friendly clean energy with new generation solar panels roofing like a shining beacon on the whole world
a few weeks ago we lost are beautiful 2 year old dog to a speeding truck that didn ’ t see her
puts things in perspective on what matters most
to love and cherish each other and the world around us for this brief and fleeting moment in time
they burned it purposely in order to build some other pagan structure for even more wicked acts
she is now 855 years old
she 's not dead she 's just going to need time to get back on her feet
the main one is saved even if the roof dating back to the 13th century has disappeared and its loss is irreplaceable as other unique and precious parts have also disappeared in the flames

i honestly don ’ t care
surprised how quickly notre dame burnt
sad moment because this is proud of france
isnt it something that if theres no god and purpose to life then this is all humanity has to look forward to just destruction whether it be everything burning or the sun burning out..but its definitely been proven by science that we humans only have so long till the sun goes out or the universe keeps expanding..and then buildings like this wont have to much meaning to people at that point
a glass roof will be amazing but nothing can replace the history the love the awe of the centuries and the ghosts of those amazing people who imagined and built it
but the twin towers dropped within minutes right
would also that the cathedral could speak and reveal how many episodes
i live in fresno california united states and my well wishes and prayers go out to the people there in paris
is n't the multicultural weapon a wonderful thing for the international criminal corporate cabal
in 2016 i was lucky enough to travel to paris and london with my girl scout troop after years of hard work to raise money
but the churches oh god they were my favorite part of the entire trip
seeing the beauty and history i ca n't even really remember what they looked like on the inside but i remember how i felt walking in there and seeing the gorgeous architecture i can literally feel my heart breaking as i watched this tears came rushing to my eyes when i saw the reality of the situation i can only say thank god nobody was hurt physically
its funny the shock of the world every time he does it
since the start of time or nearly
dance so fast and freely
bright red demons thrash about
800 year old cathedral partly catches fire and everyone is in tears
rainforests that have stood for millennia full of animals and more beauty burns/gets chopped down and no one cares
in this day and age the question is worth asking and it would not surprise me for it to be so
a project for 'modern architects
perhaps the best approach would be to let the surviving intact stone structure segments be testament to it 's past glory
within one week there is 700 million for rebuild.if somewhere is a disaster where people die with most difficulties 10 millions they get and this church has over billions on bankaccount
i hope this was an accident because if it was set on purpose well then prepare for a shit storm of fighting so sad to see this beautiful architecture lost our thoughts are with you over there 🇨🇦
waow o
i ’ m more pissed cause the hunchback is now homeless
the trump administration is responsible for this
look how we make clear to them the signs then look how they are deluded
0:45 0:47 why is there a white cross made out of light clearly visible in the smoke
i hope this will never happen again because this was one of the most important churches of the world i hope paris will get better sooner because a lot of bad things are happening in this world but god will be with us
it ’ s free will people look it up
an inside mossad job like the destruction of the twin towers in new york
please we need to start careing about real stuff like lost souls that need to find jesus
suzanna maria emmanuel explains all read sovereign lord emmanuel ’ s book the truth will set us free
wow 850 years old
most likely that 's the case
right before good friday and easter sunday
c'est dommage que la france ait perdu quelque chose d'important pour le monde
really
karma hahaha
and yet barely any reports from western newspapers
there is a higher authority who ’ s judgment you will never escape
how could a fire be so large
they burning up all them secrets of them priest touching them lil kids

its going to be a long hot summer in france this year
oh that ’ s hot that ’ s hot
huge
hahahaahah rip that building burned down that ’ s hilarious lmao rip u french baguette nibbaz
0:46 to the right of the clouds you can see the cross being formed in the clouds of smoke

thanks for still trading with us uk and keeping ties no matter of brexit wish i could say the same for most countries of the eu
thanks mr trump my bike 🚲 always gets stolen i ’ m going to build the wall around my garden to its 5ft at the moment think i do 7 to 8ft dam thieves
long live my president
leave morgan to be free
thanks
this man is fantastic
new york city is getting invaded with ilegal immigrants
they get more benefits than us legal ones
trump is more focused on the wall more the 137 us military killed in afghanistan 2 weeks ago
yer u won ’ t need the military lol alright 😂😂😂
god bless britain first tommy robinson and brexit
he 's going to go down as one of the best president ever that 's a man keeps his promise
he 's done a good job so far
is china really sure about this
drug cartel in the philippines are mostly came from china god
trump we have been working very close to south korea..south koreans you just messed up everything and said you deserved the nobel peace prize
europe needs a trump or many trump 's or all is lost
planes boats nice game
how clever is that
lol it is emergency yet you said none is care
now i know the meaning of ramble lol
so if a drug dealer sells drugs to users and gets the death penalty what 's with gun shops and people with guns tools made to kill in the first place
ofc they get to live
great logic
i mean this lunatic got to be one of the most powerful people on our planet
first he wanted 5.7 but now it 's 8 so what about the extra 2.3
global warming is major concern than building wall
better start ur own wall construction company 😃😃
can we just build a wall around dc a really high wall
make more jobs
finally the wall may be complete
smart move
wow a true great
an intellectual giant
greetings from uk where most people are jealous americans have such a great leader unlike ours teresa may
considering how little this slob does its amazing how much destruction he 's wrought i suppose less is more
drug free united states
best president ever
so in terms of setting a precedent this is huge
he wants america in mars 😂😅 i hope america will still be praising his work makeamericagreat
the honorable donald j trump the best and greatest president in history
best leader in the world trump
the last few years have proven that american democracy is n't the best system in the world
i forgot what having a mature and smart sounding president is like
wouldn ’ t a dome work better
i love breaking news bbc
he 's right walls do work
20:00 for him real country real people are trumptarts 😂😂
you are doing good things for your nation
high time
sir what about india more than 40 crpf has killed by ied by pakistani terrorist
the brave president will do anything necessary for good sake it 's country 👍
so we all gon na ignore the fact that not 2 long ago he referred to the wall as a future trump monument
3 minutes in ok either his dementia is worsening or he 's high as a kite
that would be a far better system than what trump wants to do
one big global scam that allows them to show complete indifference and just take their piece of the pie
that 's long term good will which translates to improved gdp
this orange only wants a monumentum to his megalomania and gain with maintenance after his admin is over
great speech president trump 👌👍
he is the one who lies constantly and never gets his facts right
there are many other topics that need to be acknowledged already
🎼someone is rich but his mind is not civilized 🎵🎵🎵
did he say he wants to kill people who sell dangerous drugs he better start with pharmaceutical lobbyist
great man
i would say prior administrations caused the internal economic and employment problems foreign countries been laughing and took advantage
we love what your doing
the greatest us president in our lifetime
how many times did he repeat himself
to help their flat earth from niburu and its planetary fly by that happen every 3600 years
even though he is a shitty president but got to admit he is awesomely hilarious 😁😁😁😁
11:53 nice comment taken vastly out of context by bbc
he is the first to have enough balls to do something about it
i live in california and the illegals here think that nobody can touch them
this is the most powerful man in the world
got ta be a special place in hell for the people who put him in power and for those who keep him there
ok
the us has become a great feeding tray full of parasites
as to the national emergency it is a must step for security stability and as he rightly mentioned no borders no nation can exist
the president can clean up the nation like never before and set the native-english antiquity in its rightful pedestal and preserve the social quality
does n't sound like an emergency more like a plan
trump would have more success convincing people the earth is flat than getting the wall built
so he kept his word probably the first politician to do so
us and uk got rich off selling opium in china once
no one builds a better great wall than china
trump should be focusing more on climate change then a wall
the purpose of human life is spreading happiness around the world
god gives us a wonderful opportunity to make this world a wonderful place
everything can be changed when we clear our mind about the purpose of human life
each and every moment become magical when we like each other
the magical power love within you makes wonders in human life
he better have some strategy in mind or this is just one huge mistake
the more illegals the better
come in we are happy to support you
best president ever in my opinion build the wall
that ’ s won a be a very large titanic and big wall of shame for the history of usa
i think that it is a good idea to make a wall
trump a real leader maybe uk will get ride of flip flop may
love from the london u.k get it done mr trump
i feel so much safer and proud to see this man taking care of business and responsibility of american people
a real leader of men
he needs to receive many humanitarian awards to say the least
thank god america had/has some smarts left to elect him into power
he makes me proud again to be american
why not spend those billions on helping the mexican economy grow and prosper so people wo n't even want to cross over then we can also benefit from having a successful neighbor
many previous presidents have said the same things
so many lies and false statements in this 20 minutes
nice thumbnail
you guys in the states are so fortunate to have such a skilled orator at the helm
i do n't think there can be any doubt that this surely trump 's magnum opus will go down in history alongside churchill 's 'we shall fight on the beaches speech and mlk 's i have a dream
the man is a modern day shakespeare
14:48 he says the thing he 's most excited for in the china trade deal is them executing drug dealers 😀
london used to have a wall china had a wall all great nations build walls
trump is right yet again
we need more bacon on mcdonald 's pancakes
build a wall like a the great wall of china
history says no matter how advanced you build a wall as a protection someone will always get past it
there is crisis when thousands invaders attempt to stampede into our country and drugs smuggled in since we are the most profitable market in this part of the world
the wall is one main infrastructure needed together with many surveillance monitors both on ground and under
the main reason for the canal was economic as well as security of the country
the president wanted the us to be able to move navy ships quickly from the atlantic to the pacific ocean
first of all im deeply thankful for trump 's stance on venezuela i feel his support will bring in real change
there are far better ways to tackle the immigration problem
i wonder how many more times we 're gon na hear the exact same speech
his first sentence ‘ we have a group in china doing negotiations who knows what that means ’ ha
no mention of this bangladeshi british passport holder islamic state jihadist who wants to come 'home typical bbc bias from this publicly funded squawk box for the far left
that 's the wall pretty much guaranteed
he spoke very well
he conveyed his point of view quite clearly
trump is the one of the reason china to become super power
by any means he wants to matarialise it
build a new berlin wall on the us border with mexico
best 21:00-23:00 😂😂
the boarder is clearly safe enough for murikas maga in-bread morons to join hands and act like a special ed class on a field trip
you do n't have free speech only us americans do
build a wal and then just let in legal immigrants who are still not us
불량배는 모조리 다 때러잡는다 ok
looks like the aipac gave him the green light
get ready mainstream media people waking up to your lies
absolute clown
our country is doing very well
he 's right about one thing
he 's excited about their deaths
how much more are we supposed to tolerate

and then about two weeks ago there were a family that was arrested because in their garage an hour away from where i live they had been building bombs and it was the fbi that had tipped off canada 's federal police these people were completely undocumented because our prime minister personally vouched for every single person he let into this country without documentation and decides that he 's not going to document
with this new perspective i think walls might actually be a good idea
the immigration policy in general need to be updated
i love this donald
good investment about time
great news
yes america first
political right 💩💩
tell rich people to stop buying coke
this guys great for the british economy the second he destroys the american economy were that much closer to being the the worlds top power next to russia i say let him do what he wants
this is the greatest president america has ever had he does n't aim for political correctness or political approval in order to do the right thing we only hate him because of how the media displays him to us but in reality check his record outstanding
see how he easily he takes away our attention from venezuela and that humanitarian aid to a wall
we love trump
we love trump
i do wish that media would call the 2016 campaign by it 's true name the
we must win in 2020 to kill that virus
seems to me that the personality type of the people he wants to stop coming in are the same sort of personality types that built america rogues thieves and pirates
has n't anyone ever noticed how loads of americans particularly the ones they class as 'great or 'famous all claim a hereditary to england that they ca n't prove from people here that were 'somebody and never just an ordinary everyday kind of person
anyone would think they went round checking out our history before they wrote some of theirs lol
ohh aaarrr lol
great trump has guts uk brexit dealers take notes
it does n't sound or look like emergency trump with a cool blue tie talking about china uk trade good relationship with china success summit vietnam summit with chairman kim chung un best friend exciting to meet a little rocket man talking about agenda of the meeting very relax over 5 minutes talking about bla bla
i have just completed reading crippled america by donald trump what a awesome book we need this guy in the uk
individual companies such as the trump family organisation itself realised that they could exploit poverty stricken chinese workers instead of having to pay decent wages in the us
when did the comment section become reasonable
o.o
note how the bbc run stories and quotes from robert muller on its website but completely avoids running stories like that on youtube
i ca n't tell you how much i detest the bbc these days
damn u wan na be a president of china or u r in love with the country
why does it take him twenty five minutes to say what normal people would be able to say far better in only five minutes
i really does seem like he struggles with his thoughts
well historically national emergency declared by the us president is nothing new under the sun in the usa
since 1978 the us presidents have declared 58 national emergencies connected to many kind of situations in the usa and worldwide
for example president barack obama declared 13 national emergencies during his 8 year us presidency without this kind of ridicule and deeply politicized media circus
there are 31 old national emergencies today officially going on in the usa connected for example to cuba zimbabwe yemen etc
i think i know the reason he does that sound with his nose
too much soda coke in certain people the amounts of sugar creates mucus and therefore the necessity of making that sound when breathing
is the emergency that no one is responding the way he wants them to
arizona new mexico and texas have some of the most dramatic natural “ walls ” in the usa
big bend national park park for instance astounds in stature and height with its natural beauty as a wall along the rio grande
mr trump is appropriate and good president for american
trump just wants another concrete edifice built by others paid for by others and slapped with the trump family brand for eternity
so proud of our president
trump is still millions of times better than hillary
he is the president to make life more colorful
i love this guy
the beginning portion is interesting everything is well type speech
then comes the national emergency and the democrats shoot the baby with their new 4th trimester baby killing gun which they just invented
democrats and republicans are all together they all want this national emergency gray state today starts the day of martial law will see how fast they accelerate things from here
you are amazing

hahaha
make america great again
heard it here first folks
excellent
i laugh whenever i visit the bbc news web-site and read the anti trump comments
you people need a better news source
the best president ever trump 2020 too
the big beautiful powerful trump wall
unemployment is down but that isn ’ t the only requirement for full employment
we have many corporations that avoid providing benefits by limiting hours
full employment also includes fair wages that allow the middle class disposable income and buying power
lastly we are making the best use of the skills of the majority of the population
i am sure others can provide their experience
so other than low unemployment we haven ’ t met any of the other criteria for full employment
good
oh i 'm the best
we have never been respected by china and now because of my awesomeness they respect us very very much
to make usa great again will require to declare the democrat party a subversive terrorist organization that it is and must be outlawed
we are supposed to learn from the past to be able to prepare for the future ‘ walls work ’ what about the berlin wall what about the 23 murders
that ’ s a huge amount
trump doing more for the benefit of the usa than any leader in the last 50 years and the sneering weasel liberals ca n't take it
lol and his friends at fox like hannity do not comment other than to of course back him with bs
trump just a complete lying conman

president of america donald j trump america loves you forever “ you the first and the last president ever in the history of america america except you 2020again l god blessed america 2016 he will bless america 2020
the president of america donald j trump america loves you especially the america force the army air force the navy national army president donald j trump america loves you for making america great again
but better late than never
the greatest president in my life time he give up millions of dollars from his business to be president because he loves america the need a wall these immigrants coming to america for economic reasons america ca n't save the world the have problems in the country stay there help solve it
we are getting so crowded that every one is getting cancer over crowed all these people go to the bathroom our landfill are getting full polluting our land water
we can bash trump in bbc comments but anything to do with traitor may the dictator comments are blocked brussels broadcasting corporation at its shitty best
i think the taurans live in caves on uranus
lol what a mess
how many lawsuits is this clown going to face this time
great american wall
i make more sense than trumputin when i pass gas
obama did this 11 times bush jr 12 times it ’ s nothing special in the us of a
you know it is n't real but he just spouts it out and largely gets away with it
look at his so called rally's..trump really knows how to play the 'big con'..how to 'work a crowd
it 's like watching an old benito mussolini rally
glad he did this cause democrats were resisting anything trump did even if it is the correct course of action to make for the country better
we need some sort of deterrent from more caravan ’ s from central america believing coming to us is savior those countries and there people need to save themselves and there own country and not rely on us to be there savior we have our own issues and our own people that need help
jane o ’ brien laura trevelyan and on rare occasion katty kay what do these three ladies have in common they are all bbc world news anchors that when ever they appear one can rest assured are best dressed for their performance in up to the minute in blond dyed hair which has fast become the new standard for on-screen female television news anchoring don ’ t ever tune to a news program without at least one in resident on set…for you most certainly will regret the time spent and consider yourself having been cheated…and not been given your full dose of on-screen fakery and you ’ d be wise to fact check their reporting thinking it might be bias for ratings like their appearance is most certainly is…
no seriously
i am so grateful i am not in america and can just laugh at this clown while people suffer there
humanity is in great danger
ya and your goddamn wall is really just to keep americans in and not mexicans out
the question i would ask is ‘ why do so many americans feel the need to anaesthetise themselves with opiods ’
better get used to china running the world from now on
listen to the verbal nonsense that this moronic bag of human waste touts as facts real news or accomplishments
he is by far the single biggest threat to our democracy
😂 good luck running away with broken ankles legs
spread lgbt ideas together with former uk boss fight da wars together have a happy life please do n't come back here
eradication of the kalifate ha much like the discovery of the weapons of mass destruction in iraq
say good be a good human there are hell and paradise
look at iq maps of the world to see why walls are good for north america
long live trump
greatest president of the last 100 years if not of all time
all those who think they don ’ t want wall should give up citizenships give up their rights to americans citizens go live in venezuela al salvador where they don ’ t have war
first one😎
obama clintons are globalists soros disciples trump is for strong borders the u.s.a
the global illegal drug trade is moving inexorably away from plant-based substances trafficked via traditional trading routes and onto a more high-tech platform synthetic highs made in underground labs ordered online and trafficked under cover of a million brown packages—many times more lethal than the natural highs they will soon replace
being educated and legally immigrated with voting right is the only solution in today 's developed nation 's society
right
we 'd be free and independent from the european bureaucracy
not a bad idea
so many americans fall victim to this cancer
great job mr president you have balls
are you kidding me this is the president of the united states who is losing his mind right in front of us
plus americans sell secrets very cheaply every day
he is an absolute embarrassment for the entire human race intellect
and he is saying we should kill drug dealers do we live in philippines or something
lol how he told us he is declaring a national emergency and how he expects it to go lol
good job bro
cool story
trump is doing a great job
he has done everything he promised to do just halfway through his first term
imagine if we had more politicians that actually worked on the things they talked about during their campaign
imagine if we had more presidents that were as open and transparent as this one
end birthright citizenship pass legislation to economically discourage illegals like how the government in israel did
with your right hand you save me
your love lord endures forever—
the one who vindicates me is near
thou shalt ascend and come like a storm thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land thou and all thy bands and many people with thee…
then shalt thou delight thyself in the lord and i will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with the heritage of jacob thy father for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it
then nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spake and said shadrach meshach and abednego ye servants of the most high god come forth and come hither
haha dunno why that 's what i 've decided to learn from this video but there you go
great news
great news
so far as the bbc is concerned you need to pay more attention to the massive destruction your own leaders have poured over your nation and the growing revulsion of your population at the propaganda you spew in its support
the once great britain is no longer the nation it used to be and no longer the nation we can trust over here in the us and once signed defense agreements with
we are a nation of free and independent people who shall remain free
make britain great again
trump the greatest president in the modern times
lol the end of the empire is near
tommy ’ s gon na sort you nonces out pretty soon
purely for a political agenda with no regard for the american people
i think it ’ s an utter disgrace to good people in the free western world
first view
the world leaders laugh at him and that 's something the un have never done to any head of state ever
does he think that he can and would defend his presidency as being the greatest ever in the last 10,000 years of the us

Hurricane michael
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
nature is so beautiful and untouchable
much panic and distrustion had been made
oh my goodness stay safe
text safe to 70008 to donate £5 to save the children indonesia tsunami appeal usa still has the tattered remnants of fema help the people with no such safety net
thanks
more footage of the storm in a 40 second clip than was shown on most of american news
you brits have it pretty good over there at least in unbiased news coverage
free uk
quick increase the taxes it will go away
lets continue to believe climate change is n't real
more jobs
hitting trump supporting climate chnage deniers
hurricanes make rich people into homeless people
be thankful pull yourself up by the bootstraps rich coastal hurricane victims get a job no welfare in insurance claims
i think my point is clear
declaring a state of emergency but not having anything on the standby ready to go
now do you see how easy it is to become homeless
people should care more for homelessness and do more for them
messages are loud and clear but nobody learns

Bush eulogy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
george bush did a fine eulogy for his dad
thoughts and prayers to all of your family friends and usa as a great nation 🎉
that was lovely from george w bush to his father r.i.p
watch everything is a rich man 's trick
i love this guy he is godly
awww so beautifully written xx
a great tribute to his father
i am a huge critic of george hw bush and remain so but we are all human at the end
whom among the comments community is living a life free of sin
very fitting from george bush jnr
iam crying wow love that family
god bless bush father what a great man he was
god bless the american nation what a great nation you are
a great speech and he couldnt have done this any better
just brilliant and lovely
btw i 'm also here for how d trump reacted he did n't disappoint me.i love donald trump he 's on another level person.love you orangie
must be nice having a rich daddy
this is so much more dignified and less political and enraged than mccain 's funeral such a contrast
you know how many young people in iraq died
great speech rip
a very well done eulogy from one fine man to another
bill clinton is moving his mouth around like a goat
hell has a new resident
why still he is alive
i never thought bush jr was a very good speaker i mean we 've all seen the press conference 's with proof of this but he did his dad proud with that eulogy
it was beautiful
despite your thoughts on politics at the moment despite what you think bush did or trump does we could at least be respectful enough to let the man have a funeral
there 's something to be said of being respectful enough to give your fellow human being and his mourning family time to grieve and time to remember their family member together
i 'm canadian so obviously i ca n't vote and its not my country but what happens in the usa often has an impact on us whether it be big small bad or good we are obviously closely tied with the usa and for good reason
i 'm big enough to say i did n't support a lot of things bush did but i can still say rip when he passes on and it would be nice if a lot of you in the comments that are here just to hurt someone when they are n't here to defend himself would do the same and move on
not one of you would say boo in person not one of you but being behind that screen allows you to voice opinions which is fine but we are seeing more and more of these opinions that are straight hate speech
honestly i do n't want to make people mad i just feel like i see this a lot in so many different situations and i just wish we could at least try to be decent to our fellow human beings
good radiance.one less criminal
this is beautiful just beautiful
a very touching funny and perfect speech
he was a great president
and i 'm proud to say he was my president
much love in this hard time to you and your family
and r.i p mr president and thank you for all of your service to our great country
what about the millions of innocent children souls which you slaughtered in iraq
the skull and bone very satanic world
dead dead dead this worldwide response of good riddance is what you have coming to you george w jnr
that whas great
mr president words very well spoken i will always respect the sitting president of the united states of america i respect you for your presidency i respect your father 's i even respect the president that i do n't agree with politically may you rest in peace
now answer to the one true king for your crimes death comes to us all
a thousand points of light
british accent is so cool
he should not give tribute bacoz he is responsible for killing of innocent iraqis
what a touching funny and loving tribute from his son
best speech from george w bush to his beloved father
good so
suicide bomber will be nice so many criminals together ☣️☢️
well that was truly elegant and healthy mind speaking
0:21 love how bush said presidents and first ladies and did n't acknowledge trump individually
good video
why would we say nice things about these murderers
one down couple more generations to go and we ’ ll either be rid of this family or it will have inbread enough that it ’ ll join our royal family 🇬🇧
dear president bush i sincerely wish you to burn in hell for forever
very nice eulogy for once racism/black oppression was n't brought up
they can bomb any nation without proves soon son will taste the death and dwelt in hell with his dad
now you can see that they are human just like everyone else.sorry i ca n't say the same about trump cause did you see him barely shaking his head saying no at 11:46
great
i 'm delighted he 's gone yay may he his family burn in hell bush
burn in hell
good riddance should of be swinging from a rope long ago lets hope his son is swinging from his neck before he leaves this mortal coil f king tyrants
this was a beautiful speech it 's just a shame that none of it was true
i 'll search my soul for something kind to say instead
i 'm sure his burning in hell no doubt
in my country we say.about death people only good talk.so i have nothing to say.but i 'm not sad bcz of his death.and i believe too that only few in the world care about
to all the people who chose voice your political opinion about the bush family not the time very inappropriate and shame on you
god is good
i thought today felt good and now i know why good riddance
truth is bitter lies are bitter sweet so the people have been bombarded for eons with the second option the people truly believe these lies to be the truth
may the good lord forgive us all for our judgements choices
the bush family has served the united states for many years
seeing obama and trump that close kind of freaks me out
something most of these two men ’ s victims didn ’ t get
the most successful criminal this world has ever seen
look closely as many luciferian nwo players sit in that hall
in my opinion former president bush jr handle the 9/11 attacks well i didn ’ t agree with war cause i had to say goodbye to my dad many times when he left to serve our country first time i was 4
it is so sad to see someone burying a loved one but his speech was amazing
ca n't u all give respect to the departed soul shame n disgust u haters try love in ur hear
a very underestimated man george w
david icke says this guy was really an immortal reptilian illuminati lord responsible for countless atrocities and a new world order plan of domination over the human race
pablo escobar is happy now his coke and wil flow free through the us
best president ever
you people are sitting here gawking over a traitor that mentioned the new world order over 200 times during his presidency
he is 72 and full of life but i so try not to think of the day i will have to speak in a church
what a lovely speech
whether you agree with politics or not that 's a son talking about his dad there and you can see the love
most heinous terrorist in history
so many criminals in one room honoring another criminal
whatever your political beliefs i have to say that speech was very well written and delivered with humor as well as eulogy not easy to hold one 's composure in such circumstances what sets western civilization apart is how we honor our dead nobody does it better
to hell wit the whole family
no wonder the bbc is getting excited
how many people did he kill
imagine burning for eternity lmao
lucifer is probably in hell hammering away to give his brother the best return party ever i could only imagine how over the moon he would be when his nephew joins his father and him
hope hell has a special place for him also his son
good riddance the world is a better place without these satanic zionists preparing for anti-christ
my great president george w bush
i love you sir
michelle o'bummer is the first man to be flotus 👌🏼
