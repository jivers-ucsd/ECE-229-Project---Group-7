Biden
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
how can you mention that biden ran for president in 1988 and leave out the fact that he left the race because he was caught plagiarizing speeches and also got an f on a course because his paper was someone else work
bbc was wrong about hilry the it will be the same with creepy joe
he needs a miracle
🤗
the like/dislike ratio tells you all you need to know about creepy uncle joseph
i hope not
nothing about biden ’ s horrendous record
bankruptcy bill opposition to school integration vote for iraq war and of course opposition to testimonies that corroborate anita hill
bbc news
what a shameful fluff piece without content
feel i should pay for my brainwashing my master
mr t for president
bbc backing creepy uncle joe biden
i wonder why
biden is like bbc saville
well shit now i know his family ’ s dead and he ran before but nothing that he actually stands for
mishandled the anita hill hearing
if this video and the bbc was your only source of news you 'd be thinking he sent her a letter with the wrong time on it or something
joe biden is the definition of swamp
he can only make money selling us out
rotflmao we call him creepy jo over here because that what he is
he is a career promise everything to everybody and deliver nothing politician your spin story says all we need to know about the bbc
joe hold her tighter she 's a fighter biden
lmfao
maybe clinton co should run too
third times a charm 🤣😂
trump 2020
i see he ’ s adopted anti-white rhetoric to get those minority votes
creepy bison is favouring china because they gave him a billion dollar credit
bid on is a scammer
bumbling joe was such an embarrassment
you could tell president obama thought he was a joke too he didn ’ t even endorse the guy
joe needs to be president so he can pardon these dnc rino crooks in dc
3 time loser
he 's been in the swamp decades and has nothing to show for it nor has tried to stop it
trump 2020
jr 2024 2028

the hyenas have circled and have begun feeding
sleepy creepy joe is china 's boy toy
his profitable dealings with china will eventually spill out
biden is the definition of a scum bag
creepy sleepy je has had it all with obama what does he want

the democrats are in sad shape if two old lefty farts like uncle joe and comrade sanders are their leading presidential contenders
talk about a dirty old man
creepy joe is obama 2.0
joe is hillary 2.0
been broadcast communism propaganda machine
joe biden 2020 bernie elizabeth
sleepy joe has evil eyes
beady little eyes 50 years of elevated power
where is this change in government
we see you joe
last thing we need is oboma 2.0
creepy trump walks into pageant dressing rooms to watch young girls
to appeal to disabled voters he went to a rally in a wheelchair
what a schmuck
pedo but the bbc wo n't talk about that as they protected jimmy
you do n't inform public of his 2009 brain surgery
he 's not all there
say no to creepy uncle joe bidenstein
vote dr david duke 2020
why have people forgot about trump talking about grabbing women by the p*ssy
and still sits in office as though he 's perfect..creeper

this man went through hell
dirty joe
no fukien way
joe u got this let 's get dump aka trump outta here either way trump will have his time then he 's outta here to bad it dont last 4eva
trump will stomp pedo joe into oblivion
alfred e newman in 2020
what me worry

can not wait for the multiple biden gaffes forthcoming
i would n't employ him as a babysitter i know that 🙄
he does n't have a chance
old creepy joe so many to fondle so little time 2020
na this guy is a joek
we the people do not want this catholic no good sob

just say no to creepy joe
paws off those children creepy sniffer joe
geeze he is as bad as catholic priests 😂😂😂
one creepy old guy
the bathroom line at a trump rally is bigger than his entire crowd
candidate for the president
the family guy
peter griffin
jb you can remain silent you 'll have to clear your name off the distribution list of susan rice 's infamous coa email

euds
joe you are a groper who has probably got paedophile tendencies the public videos prove it
dems 2020 x
folks america is an idea
is this the man you want leading us
america is not just some idea you can toy with and alter whenever it suits you
america is a nation
america is a conquered land
america is where traitors go to die
pedo joe 2020
biden
that drunker
just a glorified average joe a bit creepy but ultimately harmless
creepy joe
qanon
biden hope chains 2020
leftist mad mad world lol with mad maxine waters as the demwits leader and nancy skeletor pelosi and crazy keep your hands off my kids joe biden and crying chuck and the leftist demwits hysterical media it 's a helluva show rotflmfao 💜 😂

creepy uncle joe keep him away from the little children
this man brings up the debacle in charlottesville and fails to mention
1
the right-wing marchers had a permits from the city of charlottesville for all of their demonstrations/marches
2
the left-wing anti-fa had no permit
3
the left-wing anti-fa assaulted the right-wing marchers with batons flame-throwers stun-grenades and acid-bombs
4
for shame you lying sack of cow-manure
retire sleepy joe
2020 is in the bag for trump
i did n't know male pattern baldness was reversible joe
what is your special secret surely not hair plugs
since we now allow people 's appearance to be political fodder i ask uncle joe gets the same treatment
trump 2020 🇬🇧🇺🇸
no way waste of time
third time strike out
i thought i waas the only one
alex jones is at the white house
captain america went on to run for president
i was vice pres for 8 years and did nothing but take lobbyist money for my son and myself
creepy joe sniffin hair again
no way
nocreepyjoe
no
just no
americans think they 're being given a choice on the nominees
no matter what the vote says joe biden will be it
goodbye democracy
creep joe wo n't be president but you can already see the bbc narrative in this story and others.trying to condition the british public.the bbc and other news media do look empty now.its visible they are dying
corporate owned politician
trump 2020
trump 2020
trump 2020
if american politics and policies were a vehicle
just needs a few tweaks
all it really needs is few belts some hoses a little retooling an oil change a new carburetor alternator fuel injectors fuel pump air filter radiator timing chain axel rotator cuffs brakes tires oh yeah and some gas
biden but it 's vintage
this guy is not to be trusted
another corrupt career politician
just look into ukraine gas scandal

give him a shot
well
america would be less of a world joke and the butt of the world if they elected ronald mcdonald at this point
hamburgler for vp
not for one minute pedo joe will probably go to jail
biden 3.0 trump 2.0
sleepy is a deliberate euphemism for creepy
america has never once voted in a third-time presidential contender in all of its history
never once
gropemejoe 2020
are we going to talk about creepy uncle joe has brain surgery in the 80s so he 'll stop wanting to be with children choking the chicken is he would say he has some big mental problem
creepy uncle joe is his name and nothing can wash away his history of perverted behavior
just ask his secret service
tulsi 2020 she is the only real candidate with a heart and logic all the others are propaganda preachers or just plain incompetent other than yang but tulsi will do ubi also
bbc is a corporate shill
denied 👎
i wonder which candidate the establishment elite want us to vote for
forgot where i read that biden and bernie represent the old the previous
i agree
depending upon the candidates actively running in the summer of 2020 i 'd likely vote for pete buttiegieg
creepy joe has no possible chance
its an arrangement in which
the nations resources are committed to its privileged classes and the protection and enlargement of their wealth at the expense of ordinary americans
it wo n't matter whom the american people vote for nothing will change
bbc is fake news
ijs
he 's coming from democratic pete buttiget also coming from democratic
however i just want to trump vanish from pm of usa

third strike your out of hereeeeee
i would n't trust this guy to babysit my kids forget about running the country
guys a closet pediphile sickening
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
anyone can beat trump at this point😜😜😜
creepy peedofile joe 😂😂😂😂😂 keep yer has off my daughter
someone please ask dirty uncle joe
why his son was made a millionaire by the chinese

zero nothing not one
this pervert swims naked in front of female secret service agents
run dirty joe run
another obama 3rd term is not what we need

i said it before and i 'll say it again stay retired joe let 's someone else fight this one out i do n't think you will get the nomination
anybody that votes for biden or any of these left wing kooks should see a syciatris
everything was lousy during the obummer/bite me years and we do n't need anymore of this stagnation
donald trump forever
bernie 2020

i am not an american
joe biden can not even control his emotions his indecent touches and hugs should not be ignored
lock up your daughters creepy joe is back
bbc is a tool of the elite to lie to lambs and brain wash them
never happen joe
trump 2020
vote bernie and america will gain the worlds respect
i 'm not voting for a guy that keeps stands of women 's hair in his pockets
research transvestigations and pregvestigations and learn how to spot the illuminati
hell no joe we got it right finally in 2016
trump 2020

open your eyes 👀 trump is god 's work
not when he launched his campaign on a misquote of trump he 's just asking to lose
yeahhhhh yyyyaaamerica

i doubt he 'll do very well this time either once all that corruption stuff with his son and those trips to china and all that money they illegally got for other governments not to prosecute
this is the creepiest weirdo the left could get
but hey that 's none of my business
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
americans please do not vote for him
does anyone else find it creepy the way he smells feels fondles women and young girls
no i 'm not asking your opinion bbc you ca n't be trusted
the last time this happened you looked the other way
trash
cynical republican supporters always video record joe biden 's habitual gestures or way of speaking
peado these are the sort of creatures you 'd see in the purge film franchise
biden 2008
look who ’ s the next king of america
bitchass ai n't getting my vote
ukraine
trump 2020
ukrainian joe sold us out to china and ukraine for billions of dollars
it 's well know to insiders in that disgusting party
ol creepy joe just watch how he is around children and women eww 😷
get a grip at least try and deliver your propaganda on time
now there ’ s a thing uncle joe biden got a jim will fix it badge
creepy joe wants to lower the age of consent and allow men in the little girls toilet 's
we want joe
we want joe
who 's joe
ohhh creepy uncle joe touching joe groping joe caressing joe hair smelling joe
why is bbc backing up joe biden
i have seen countless videos of creepy uncle joe physically molesting children in public
the bbc has a long history of protecting paedos go figure
he 's only doing it so he can kiss lots of babies smell their hair
biden would slide his hand up your mothers skirt at the same time sick his tongue in your 9 year old sisters ear
self-righteous liberals funded by the saudis and the quataris the same people who fund isis
donald trump is number 1
sniff sniff
grope grope
nuff said
bernie all the way 2020
what a joke go back to bed joe
even the worst president in my time obama is n't supporting him
feel the bernnn 2020
hope he runs hopefully his past will finally catch up with him
shut up ross perot
creepy joe biden creepy uncle joe yuk could n't hold a candle to president trump who is a real american
hello my fellow bcc citizens my name is creepy joe and i 'm ready for president and i 'm looking forward to touching each and every one of your children and hoping one day i can molest them vote for me creepy joe
joe is feeling his way around and hopes to grab the democrat nomination but he will be squeezed out by other candidates
maybe he 's friends with jimmy you know the 1 you knew about for decades and covered up
i ca n't wait until the bbc is abolished
yt creepy joe biden
i ’ ve been learning a lot about biden
he lied about his college record and subsequently had to drop out of running for president
he also lied and said the man who crashed into his wife ’ s car killing his wife and daughter was drunk
there was never any evidence that he was drunk and the accident was his wife ’ s fault
he ruined this man ’ s life for sympathy points
trump for 2020
joe uncle bad touch biden

keep your children away from him

he 's just another lying sack of protoplasm
ron paul 2020
he is a racist and he will not win
such a touchy feely type of president
bbc pushing the democrat bias
and after 50 yrs of service bullcrap
nothing negative
then pull up any trump article and its lets dig up the dirt
bbc may be a public broadcast service its leftwing bias is terrible
😍😍😍😍😍😍♥️♥️
more pure evil from the bbc do n't pay the beast
fake as could be from his big teeth implants hair plugs and facelifts
likeable enough but is he ruthless enough

hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha even us in canada are laughing at that option
cmon liberal biased media trump is taking 2020 because people like to watch the country and the people in it prosper
sorry bbc you are backing the wrong team
joe has no chance of winning because he tried and failed to ban our guns
the only reason he and obama were elected was because they lied and said they would n't touch our guns then once elected they proposed a ban of a bunch of guns
joe has an f rating by the nra so he 's toast
run instead to home for the aged go there joe the toilets are waiting for you
such a touchy feely type of president
if usa produces 3 or 4 presidents like trum then usa will be at par with pakistan within 20 years
are we even serious as a species
millions of people are going to starve or drown if we do n't change our entire way of life and these neoliberal snakes are still trying to figure out how to keep this corrupt system going and putting up sleazebags like biden
give me a break
this moron supported an illegal invasion of iraq that has destabilized the entire middle east and killed over a million innocent human beings for absolutely nothing
blech

i want to give the middle finger to all the moral holier than thou american evangelists who spent hundreds of years giving warning about the anti-christ
yang 2020 trump 's kryptonite
the dark horse he is afraid of even mentioning
yang rallies are the only place were you will see antifa and alt-right together with out a fight breaking out
the candidate that has caught the attention of french yellow vest protestors
the only candidate that brought bloomers doomers republicans democrates millennials zoomers boomers x-gens minorities awoken never politics women independents futurists gamers artist musicians hobbyists inventors antifa alt-right cypto-techies veterans techies mothers fathers and college students together at a rally
not saying it will also happen to him but i its not always a luck

i am sorry if i offended
lizard
are those horses behind prince harry a hidden hint that the just born prince harry´s son´s real genetic grandfather is possibly princess diana´s lover cavalry officer james hewitt who has very similar face outlook than prince harry and even prince harry´s beard can´t hide it
okey they began to use the windsor propaganda name during the wwi when they tried hide that they were during that time practically 100 german royal family ruling the uk and the uk and the british empire were at war against the german empire
congratulations to the uk anyway from northern europe from partly arctic finland
it is a boy and there is no need to reorganize and reform religious life or execute royal wives who aren´t fertile enough at this time in the uk
congratulations god bless your family 😙😘

gaaf
they will divorce within five years and this thirty something american actress divorcée will be seen as the catalyst that brought down the royal family
mark my words this is historic for all the wrong reasons
as a former royalist i could n't care any less
they did nothing to stop this country turning in to the mess that it has become in fact i would say they aided the destruction of britain and the british people
breaking news

do n't care 4 million kids in poverty in uk anyone on benefits has kids they ridiculed.royals are the biggest benefit recipients going
i dont understand
how does the british monarchy help britain
is n't the prime minister enough
who cares

does anyone actually care
🤔
damn this family to hell
the prince should have little problem bringing up his baby in a normal manner and keeping the paparazzi away
we gave our child an ordinary state school education further education and eventually university
we never let the paparazzi near her and have had little or no problem with them at all
see
hoorah
let the divorce proceedings begin
it 's probably actually a girl but they feel like it 's going to identify as a boy
is it black with red hair
prince harry we had a baby boy
lgbt activists you cant assign the gender without asking the baby
j.k rowling meghan was a lesbian all along

hold the front page guys
a baby was born
he will have everything he needs since birth while others have to work 12hours a day just to survive
the queen has got all of our money and has not protected her people
typical bollocks from the bbc
biologically female but raising as male just like hollywood
👨🏻‍🦰❤️👩🏽💙👶🏽
congrats from los angeles 🏖🛣🎥🌅🏄🏽‍♀️☀️
who is gon na pay for this gender neutral kid anyway
what a waste of taxpayers money such a disgrace
anyway what is me-again doing in the country

you 're a lucky man treat her well protect her from the crazy royal life
congrats to the both of them

congratulation to the duke and duchess of sussex
i thought it was gon na be gender neutral
why you telling us

welfarebaby
ginger tosser

congs our son
congratulation is in order for the duke and duchess of sussex on their bless arrival of their baby boy
may god continue to bless you all
might as well named him muhammad now since you wastes of spaces have let the invaders take over your country
soon enough they 'll be coming for you you will deserve it for not standing up for protecting the people
congratulations❤️❤️❤️

but it 's a boy

arsenall are going to the europa league finallll
turkey sent drilling and military ships inside cyrpus eez
the eu is not doing anything about it
it 's obvious that when they talk about solidarity they only mean solidarity to germany
remember your problems are your problems
but as merkel said migration is not a german problem it 's a european problem
we should all show solidarity and accept the quota system and not leave germany alone the carry the burden
european values are all about solidarity in crisis
unless you 're not germany
then f*ck you
congrats

i hope they do n't murder their surrogate or the genetic scientists

and well done to the queen for slapping that gender neutral crap out their heads
another brat for the tax payer to fund
i wonder if it looks black megan ’ s dad was white now harry is white
race mixing is degeneracy
a crime against the eco-system
the royal family and the majority of world leaders have repeatedly downed media and news organizations for intruding on their privacy
so okay they do n't want the attention do n't give it to them.any of them including american politics
just say we could care less what you tweet instagram photograph no coverage what so ever
harry 's wife has caused a riff from day one
it 's obvious she has driven a wedge between the brothers
i 'm like a previous comment or mabe she can stop hugging her belly like she 's been the madonna with child
if you shun the media at his birth then why even make this statement to the press
you ca n't have it both ways sussex
here again attention a 250,000.00 baby shower
when children are starving
shame on you tennis star shame on you oprah and all who so hypocritically participated in such a farce

what are the responsibilities of prince according to british constitution

oh mah god can i throw it off buckingham palace

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Notre Dame
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
im going to go there in assassins creed unity and pay my respects
this will go down in history wow
what ’ s sad is how many wars it has been through yet it gets burned by probably construction
i hate seeing great history destroyed

and the french will cover everything with perfume of silence
no one died
i 'm an iraqi and in the past 200 years thousands of historical 3000 yr olds artefacts have either been stolen by the super powers or destroyed by local idiots isis
after a building burned with a few hours half a billion was raised but when thousands are killed barely anything is raised
france and the yellow vest movement
have been sent to jail
please have a look at gilets jaunes paris acte 23 footages
and please share some vids around
greetings from france
wwi doesn ’ t destroy norte dame
ww2 doesn ’ t destroy norte dame
memers destroys norte dame
i 'm not religious whatsoever but this is very very sad
this is a lesson for future
nobody cares about giving money for restoration before disaster
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
morning in paris the city awakes
to the bells of notre dame
the fisherman fishes the bakerman bakes
to the bells of notre dame
to the little bells soft as a psalm
and some say the soul of the city is
the toll of the bells
the bells of notre dame
quickest fire investigation in history
bbc discovered the cause while it was still burning
3d mapping of the notre dame in assassin ’ s creed may be used to help rebuild the cathedral
gamers rise
who made this fire
wars couldn ’ t destroy it
yet some stupid dude in a hard hat can burn it to pieces
how can you mess up so badly that a 850 year old building is in flames
bollocks it was set on fire
this was soooooo planed by the govt coz tf they would have found out who had done it by now
oh so this is what ninja did when he was in europe
guess frollo did actually burn notre dame
devastating lost for the world

i hope the reconstruction goes well and that i may someday
visit paris to see notre dame in it 's restored glory

who else re-watched the hunchback of notre dame after the news of the cathedral burning down
a building with that amount of history and importance should have had someone on watch 24/7
fires during construction or renovations are very common
it 's possible the elite did this to stop the yellow vest movement
your attempt did not work the yellow vest are still active
keep up the struggle
if only they had not 'renovated the cathedral nothing would have happened
nothing lasts forever though
tell us about all the other attacks on churches
is this is all you can conjour saruman

wait did richter use holy fire
smh
quasimodo 's mixtape was fire 🔥🔥🔥
buildings became vital not lives anymore sad world
i smell an inside job
i express deep sorrow for the loss of ancestral church
the fire bird strikes again

people will read this in books now
thats crazy
this seriously broke my heart
not because i 'm a catholic nor am i french but because this was a staple of western architecture and history
i feel so sore thinking of this

y ’ a pas de français là 🙋🏼‍♂️🙃
lost an adifice pray no lost lives
law enforcement was going to raid the church for child porn..they got wind and started a fire in attic to destroy evidence
an accident during holy week i ’ m not buying it
jesus christ older than this medieval mess
i 'll wait
knock it down build a mosque
youtube ban t series
this is arson
all those centuries lighting the inside with candles and never burnt down
choose me or the fire
ninja did what in europe

i 'm so depressed to see this
the sight of burning history makes my heart bleed
i 've been wanting to visit france since i was 12
i bet someone did it on purpose
time will tell
the link in the description
it definitely will be rebuilt
somebody destroyed my property too
bummer
if that was in usa 🇺🇸
they would liberate north korea for some reason
well at least the stone front/walls are left standing
it is terribly sad but some of it will be salvageable
they will rebuild
there is nothing else to do
on rancho across from santa fe casino above it
we 're they keep the white stripe tigers
scared me stiff
our lady
notre dame
priez pour nous
i wonder if this will spawn any anti-catholic legislation
it is home to 1000 's of catholics
its just a building
who let charmander out again
i 'm not french i 'm not religious
it does n't matter this was a loss for everyone
ah yes macron taking notes from george bush i see
that was funny no more notre dam 😂😂😂😂
i 'm cant explain how the people feel i could feel their pain😪😪
god is in control
we can adore worship and hold value to worldly things but god has the last day so
troy t the editor
power players online
it 's a church
it was touched by the mongol hord
i wonder if they had proper fire detectors and sprinkler systems etc
why did it get so out of control
this is so depressing
tonight i cry and pray for the loss of such a sacred space 💔 i cry for the loss of a dream to see the magnificence that was this building
the host should ’ ve turned fire spreads off smh
renovation without proper safeguards led to this catastrophic disaster
how can a raging fire when spread be controlled other than selective operations aimed at salvaging transferable artifacts besides just waiting for the flames to die down
3 duality
michael threatens 3dd collapse if you do n't stop
karma

they wo n't let u talk about what 's going on in eruope
not on there watch this was not an accident
beast system manifesting
the world trade center with all it ’ s metal and concrete went down faster then this
so sad to see and heard the news😓😓
wonder if there 's any architect philosophers out there that can fix this problem
when you think of paris notre dame is one of its icons
to watch it burn was distressing a medieval masterpiece
i hope it rises from the ashes like a gallic phoenix
vive la france vive la notre dame

the loss of those stained glass windows is a tragedy
i feel kinda ill
i would go there in ac unity but my disk set on fire
assassin 's creed can help rebuild notre dame
sounds like a yikes to me
unbelievable
this is not just a loss for parisians this is a loss for all of christianity just days away from easter as well as a loss for western civilization itself
it took place in the holy week before easter
accident
i think not
toussaint louverture did it🇭🇹
multiple goths have fallen
when you miss a duolingo lesson
my heart is with france tonight
god bless
did the hunchback escape
a number of churches have caught on fire over a number of weeks a coincidence
obviously it 's a religious motivated attack only they 'll not tell you that one fire possibly an accident but four and five i 'd say not
fake-news
this was a bomb
it is a devastating loss for all
so thankful no one lost their lives
finally some vacant property to start walmart in europe
let 's go meme time
i think jesus his close to us
macron you naughty boy 🔨
it 's not 'just a building
thank god no one lost their lives and i believe they should rebuild but it 's a terrible loss
thumbtack
stole me
i want it gone forever

may god be with us all
an optimistic year awaits us all
c'est tellement triste c'était un endroit magnifique
europe has been lost to the towels
jesus christ😭😭😭😭
that 's a bruh moment
signs of things too come
oh god frollo got his revenge
burn like you burnt those heretics
i noticed inside the cross had survived the destruction it 's a sign that hope is not lost
they will rebuild and it will last a thousand years
am i the only one who thinks disney knew the future

sacrificial burn offering
i feel bad that i dont share the same feeling
very sad for paris
broke a bone now replace it with a fake one
some didimt just get fired but had a capital punishment
trust the french to burn down a national treasure
there is no lord but the one
guess television shows and movies predicted the future again
like did n't the tower of notre dame burn down in the hunchback of notre dame and the same thing has happened in reality years after the movie had come out
one example is the simpsons predicting donald trump 's presidency way before it actually happened in 2016
i just find it a coincidence that it happens on holy week
governance failure
what do you need for a roof a saw angel grinder tape and a pencil but it still catches fire

macron will blame an insane dutchman
the muslim population in france has taken credit for this atrocious act
the msm will not report this
bruhhhh i didnt even get to travel there yetttttt
doctor sir you have been in a coma since 1875
man oh boy
doctor well um
so sad 😢 😢 😭😭😭 why did this had to happen 😭😭😭😭😭
i 'm afraid this is just a fore-warning for france
this is your country now
utterly on fire and in chaos
heartbreaking
alright time to meme it
what people forget not only the fire but the water used to put it out will cause damage
it was ninja look at his europe video
should ’ ve left the statutes there
rip
😢
i hope they can rebuild it
t series is sub botting
ca n't we get those renovators to come and work on the houses of parliament
how did the fire start
who was in the attic when the fire started
the
workmen in the attic taking out statues for restoration what are their
backgrounds
this was a catholic
church
represented christianity for centuries
just saying
everybody if you see this
please go to the cnn site or look up donate to notre dame rebuilding and give money
guys this is history that burnt
let ’ s help try and bring this back together
it was probably the work of muslim vandals
quasimodo predicted this would happen in 2019 and was ignored
some speculated he was basing his prediction on nostradamus others say he just had a hunch
never been to france never been to europe
never left the u.s but this sure makes me sad
i hope it gets rebuilt
the vatican is next according to the bible
hellfire
hellfire
goes down in rubbles and flames
but look at the brighter side it 's brighter now
oh well 🤷
find it odd that the french authorities have not mentioned what caused the fire
i have worked on historic renovations over 10 years in various countries
i wonder if there was not purposely set on fire by a non-frenchman
put some holy water
eyes opened slowly
why is everything bad happens on april 15th

some ones getting fired lmfaoo
sad day for art and history
sad day sad moment
believe in jesus ot other
0:46 look in the smoke
that 's a cross
we will see
this breaks my heart
albert pike 3 world wars
omg so sad 😱😪😢
this is pretty sad this historical land mark is permanently disfigured
what are they going to do with the remaining building are they going to rebuild are they gon na restore the insides of the remaining building or are they gon na let it sit
aha you sad c ” nts
you can guess who will be cheering
well rip my dude
we must rebeild
can we get an f in the chat
pls back sub
i do n't care how much hate i will get in these incessant comments
our world is ending
you ’ re name is backwards btw
france gave us the statue of liberty in 1886 i think it 's long overdue to give back
praise altman
i learned that punch from bruce lee
let 's get f in the chat for respect
ninja did this
it 's sad because it was a symbol of the greathenss of humanity this 10 full human lifetimes cathedral was a symbol of the eternal beauty and symbolism
damn jesus dropped some fire
was it set ablaze
it took 200 years to built
and it only took 30 minutes to destroy
the notre dame football squad is reportedly unscathed
cap dies in endgame
the news reporter face really sad 😥
the joker is back at it again
when i heard about this i immediately thought this was a cause of arson
some turk did it
the roof the roof the roof is on fire we do n't need no water let the
the same buildings we have already built in this generation will also be history at some point and so on
nothing lasts forever
😣🇸🇦-🇫🇷😢💔
somebody messed up big time
i wonder if the 'experts that putin has offered to send are the same cathedral enthusiasts as the ones who visited salisbury cathedral last year
my heart is breaking while watching this
this is not only national disaster to france but it is international disaster for all the mankind
but we have to be shame as us as today 's generation we could n't save it for future
bs gby
keywords medieval architecture
omg so sad
we 're sorry about this thing from japan🇯🇵
quazimoto did it
why they did not use plane fire fighters
poor quasimodo
i wonder if the african man who scaled an apartment to save a child was there as a part of his job as a fireman which came with his french citizenship
very sad to see 850 years of history and culture reduced to ruins in just over a few hours
i blame gods indifference
everything that has a beginning has an end
i hope we did a photogrammetric scan of it before it burnt

a heart-breaking day for france and the entire world
absolutely devastating
use helicopters
rest in flames
well that building is history
i blame frollo
what words the cross survives
during holy week
the world on fire it starts now
what will be the next miracles r coming believe or nor
humans ruin everything
so sad day
800 years of history burned
what if someone put gasoline on the cathedral to get back at the government for raising gas prices
could have been worse though could have been one of our historic cathedrals ……
marcon or maricon
i would like to kindly invite people in the comments to not rush to judgement to not ruin the blessed memories of notre dame while it still stands with blind hate and distasteful jokes
notre dame is one of the few places that could make even a non-believer pray and left in awe
i pray for the fire-fighters where the hell are the helicopters btw
and wish i could help contribute a bucket of water or something it pains to just watch it burn
three things to consider
it is not like they are still using candles or lanterns while working
inez madani an islamic radical was recently sentenced to jail for attempting to propane-bomb the cathedral in 2016
one would think that after this incident security would have been tightened around the area
one can only compare a burning campfire being doused by an accelerant
i was there a couple months ago now to know it ’ s burning down
may god bless france and all the world
it was arson
sums up the current state of affairs in france
notre damn🍆😫🔥
well that was a bad renovation work
😢
i had a dream last night that thousands of muslims showed up and started
so sad
i very😢😢😢
was this sad event a natural mistake or has happened in purpose
the world is changing
oh lord what a terrible shame
i hope the hunch back is alright
those people are disgusting
i 'm not christian and i 've wanted to visit it before
it will take generations to fully restore
this is not just a loss for france this is a loss for the world
we will help how we can
i burned the cathedral
👌🏾😆
it ’ s was a sad day😢
damn it quasi
i saw this on a simpsons cartoon what a shock.our government is so evil and mentally ill i would hate to see what happens to them in the end.lord have some mercy on their souls it 's going to be real bad for them
re build again
turn turnt
burn
burnt
finally something not in america
another devastating blow to france and its dying culture
horrific and sad beyond words
i am from macau
马克龙执政，notre dame cathedral 都自焚了。
this is affront on the female manifestation of god
the timing of it and religious implications are truly heartbreaking and startling
literally no one
reddit 😂😂😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
all man done
10 churches were attacked in one week even before this one was burned it 's not accident it 's an attack
sheesh this just so sad in so many ways
是个很大的损失……
i bet ninja did this
what is the name of this reporter
she did n't over blow it for sensation
i stopped watching news that look for viewers by flashing cleavage from the women and trouser bulge on the men
this was well done
i can only imagine that collective silence
just found it sophie raworth well done
😭😭😭😭oo notre-dame 😭😭😭😭
it is after all the beginning of the holy week of easter
i feel bad 😢
this is terrible pray for paris
got jesus christ everyone
truly symbolises the death of western culture
holy smokes 1safe1not
and then the fire nation attacked
so sad 😧😔
notr damn
oh no

then something will be saved
türkler burdami
so sad 😐😐
i agree
this is genuinely so sad future generations will never see this
i have known of a lot of building that have burned because of debt
and it is always electrical
room 8 killer
your war crimea are mounting
the teenage psychotic is what mathew calls you
rachel maddo
she seems to think i 'm her
why
the catholic church is asking the world for money towards rebuilding notre dame when the catholics bask in a paradise of gold wealth then again they need help due to their losses towards abuse lawsuits
the workers needed 200 years to build notre dame the fire needs 200 minutes to destroy nearly all
why they put it on fire
聖母院不是僅僅作為一個藝術博物館存在，而是人類主流社會天主教基督教的宗教精神象徵之一，這與阿房宮和圓明園是人類社會暴戾腐朽的無神論奸惡蠢惡權貴存在象徵是本質完全不一樣的存在。
how sad another symbol of our culture art and civilization is gone my heart cries with all parisians today
at 0:46 seconds there is a white cross in the sky
guess quasi moto ca n't help here sp
i saw
a tourist wearing a t shirt that said my dad went to paris and all i got was this burned up t shirt
thoughts and prayers from egypt
i would have cried too
hold on while i try to care people are raising money to rebuild it but doesn ’ t the catholic church have enough money already
burn baby burn
this is so sad
this is all your fault sandusky
are you kidding me
any word on the hunchback
did he get out
i have a hunch he perished
no longer a member of the parish
yet will always be ours our humpback of paris
guys do something about this
french people what are guys doing take care of your place

im ashamed to even watch american news channels becoming nauseous with all the sensationalism and over dramatic words i am sad for our french brothers and sisters of faith

i 'm french
terrorism not construction
are they gon na repair
lets hope there was video surveillance i doubt this was caused by renovations
これを見てうれしい
damn
i dont mean to joke but did judge claude frollo not find his gypsy again
but seriously
i am so sorry for paris loss
my thought same wth ppl in paris
i was praying and i said king david and the cloud turned around with a face on it
let 's go
it was the kkk burning the cross
le groupe punk a sorti une vidéo prophétique une semaine avant les tristes événements de notrdam de paris

https www.youtube.com/watch v=xaduksdrkz8
i cried watching it burn yesterday and prayed to god to help all those fighting this fire and to bring peace to the french people in their hour of need
vatican city next you can only imagine the unspeakable foul acts performed by the cardinals priests and bishops over the time since the church was erected
and do n't say it never was
you value the innocence of artifacts
the indulgence of opium whilst the feasted on the innocence and took advantage of their youth
i say let all those foul churches burn
and again this was no accident it was purposely done
listen this happending makes no sense

3.a week before easter huh
what are u dumb this is an arson
4
ninja did it
here is another thought
and i guess in many quarters it will go down badly
so be it
but the truth is the truth
i am not an expert on this
so this happens a cry goes out for donations i hear millions billions pledged
here is my question
what about the hundreds of millions upon millions collected over the years
who pocketed it
oh well i rest my case
signs
heart burning feelings
it ’ s just a mf church wtf
a month ago the saint sulspice church in paris was on fire
notre dame and al aqsa mosque burnt on the same day
who are the culprits
read revelation 3.9
on this day
the titanic sank
national tax day in the united states
district of columbia celebrates emancipation day



april 15
😥
god help them
oh no
crap that 's so sad
macron 's france
and what the bbc does n't mention are the dozens of christian churches that have been vandalised over the last year or so
they ignore the fact that churches have been increasingly vandalised since the mass immigration from muslim countries
vivre le france
we ’ re with y ’ all
this however was never a monument to christ rather to a man made power structure known as catholicism which masquerades as a route to jesus and heaven
let me know when vatican 🇻🇦 starts burning
73 questions with kim kardashian 22 million views
what is wrong with people
this was a terrible person if someone di this burn notre dame ♥💙😢 a historical society of france paris this is a terrorist attack the government of france needs to fine out what and answer questions 😔
realizing that it ’ ll go down in history
it took 3 generations to build it
675 million dollars to rebuild in less than a week
imagine if that money was used to feed the hungry before this all happened
pray to jesus for rebuild this
nothing happens for 800 years
6.8 million dollar projects happens
hhhmmmmmmmmm wonder what it could have been
brought a tear to my eye.such a shame
fire brigade have no copter squads
that 's crazy cause history is just crumbling before their eyes
yaaaa that ’ s hot🔥🔥
merci
this is the 4th church to be vandalized this year in france its happening all to often now this was no accident
notre dame est en flammes
c'est juste terrible
terrible
elle est avec le pays depuis 800 ans
mon coeur est brisé
je prie que nous pourrons reconstruire la structure endommagée tout en nous souvenant des jours plus anciens preuve de notre humanité persistante sur cette planète
billy joel 's we did n't start the fire
i also saw a feirce eagle red clouds
i do n't use drugs
somebody was smoking thats why it started
i pet goat 2
for the grace for the might of our lord
for the home of the holy
for the faith for the way of the sword
god bless the men that have died for the cause of christianity
its a sign the death of france
meu deu eu lamemdo muimdo
bbc is fake news
this has not hurt chistanaty only made it stronger preys jesus
this is why you never go with the low bidder on any construction project
thanks macron you sick jerk
i never imagined it to become history
then it burned down
saddest moment 😢😢😢😢
i visited and went through to see it in 1984
just as all was cleaned up after ww2 bomber squadron damage
they mean a catholic icon
just another building rebuild in five years what a knee jerk reaction
the government
set on fire deliberately
dont worry its insured
a holy mosque will be built in place of it
no problem
strange never i read information s manifest yellow west
the france is dictature the manisfestation are prohibited
the people are arrested for nothing
the french ask ric frexit but macron doesn t like
few people haven t hand or eyes for the policies violence
à day the french people ask thrue at all journaliste than said nothing
yellow west here for ever for have a life with dignités
the people are arrested before the manifestation
don t forget a day the thrue arrive
are the gargoyles saved
gargoyles on a church
everything has its time
everything dies
just devastating to all those who one day wanted to see it
jesus would say no to the massive amounts of money to rebuild and he would want it to go to homeless people
restauration worker „ oh ”
anything else is a mislabeling and a distraction from the truth
مشاركين بقتل لمسلمين ستأتي الطامهٌ الكبرى وعد
somebody is going to get yelled at for this one
never even got to see it 😢
did enyone die
babylon is falling
我是来练习听力的
them oh no the building collapsed
me it ’ s a building i never heard of no one died
the only church that illuminates is a burning church
a symbol of the fall of western civilization
whoever does not have even what they have will be taken from them
chistanaty is not made of wood
build on lies torture a cleansing
i swear to you that i know a 7,000-year-old building
why 😭
was it arson
damn its so lit to see this almost as lit as the church itself
inside job
why are you scrolling through the comments there was a fire
arson

i would trust what the mass media says is the cause of this not at all
a serbian church whether french bonus survive
i have little faith in the restoration because i just know they will grab this oppurtunity to make some modern additions like a glass roof or skylights or some other shit architects have no respect for traditional architecture these days
this happens right before easter that is just sad
😭 全人类的损失 😭
the power of fire
unbelievable
micron says he 'll rebuild it
this hits me in an emotional place that i did n't realize it held
7:03 is that one of quasimodo friend 🤔🤔
it 's too long
this is why i watch inside edition 😂
our lord jesus christ is coming soon let us prepare our hearts these are the signs
an accident in holy week not buying it
such is the state of the world
🥺😔😢
is this the first attack of the demon king i ’ m sorry everyone i thought i finished him with my flame lotus
it started 6 days before easter sunday hmmm
moi quand je voit que c en anglais
soit j'écoute et j'essaye de comprendre comme sa j'aurai gratter des mots de vocabulaire
soit jm'en fous jregarde juste les image et le premier mot des passants qui est en français
soit je sort
finalement g choisie la 1 mais a la fin j'avais la flemme du coup g fait la 2
😂
about time
我觉得是伊斯兰难民烧毁的，这么多年都没事不可能就这么烧了
this is 🇫🇷 france 's 911

it 's not a terrorist attack by isis they would 've already said something about it it 's just probably a human error that caused this fire
i imagine something similar happened in paris because the workers also were done for the day here in my hometown but than tone of the workers smelled fire so i guess whatever happened in my hometown also happened in paris
from 0:46 to 0:47 there ’ s a cross that comes through in between the smoke anyone see it
wow omg so sad
i 'm an atheist and i do n't respect this religion in the slightest
that being said this is a terrible tragedy
the things that this hand built beauty lived through to come down like this the thing is as a construction worker i know a building this old is kindling absolutley terrible
karna gw gak bisa bhs inggris komen bhs indonesia aja lah
semoga diberi kesabaran pada keluarga korban maupun pemilik perusahaan amin
watch it turn out that one of the workers on that portion that was being renovated tossed his cigarette on the roof
yes thé enemy tried to do this to st sulpice two week ago it is not an accident it is an attack
macron is behind it after all he is one of thoses it is an act of war against christian france
it is not an accident
anyone else not knows what is happening

wolverines
this is a very sad news for the world i hope the france people could stay stronger
i dont know if any of you believe this or not
such as the chinese stone lion and dragon status
notre dame belonged to everyone it has been apart of everyone 's life
so sad and completely irresponsible
unlucky😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
this is horrible how can it big church like that just burn so quickly and burn at least for half of it i 'm sure it was n't an accident i 'm sure that it was prepared and it was n't just one person that prepared that
we really have to talk about it and jesus christ crown was in there and a lot of things were in there that lasted at least 850 years
this is sad but at least they 're still a jesus cross left that means that there is still hope
keep praying for others and keep thanking god for what you have
imagine seeing it all burn down
sad to see it survived ww2 but could n't survive some 21st century idiots rebuilding it
unfortunately something fishy is afoot
do n't worry about that building god never sleep god working mystery way they worship all kinds of animals in that building
so y ’ know that song hellfire
there sadder at a building then back in the day when they got terrorised
i ca n't say anything
i am sad from azerbaijan
maybe some priest took a nap and left his candle burning
why didn ’ t god put the fire out
now i 'm going to burn down the notre dame my friend built on minecraft
5:37 omg it was so beautiful😭😍 makes me want to cry😭
fire started soon after
last of the visitors left
but just like 9-11
they repeat a script about the cause
cross in the smoke at 0:46
so sad
condoléances 💐 mon dieu
thank god i ’ m an atheist
yahweh created the fire
he can move it
france just keeps on sucking day by day
how can a structure that has stood all these years finally succumb to fire
when franse need money
it will be rebuilt
go watch the video i pet goat ii
this was planned
christ will return
france ca n't catch a break the last few years

hugs to the french people
regresa las normas antiguas
such is the fate of all that is material
the world is in crusade so i call upon crusaders to fight this holy war
ripheathledger
i only knew about this building from assassins creed unity
the movie the hutchback from notre dame was named after that cathedral
praise god the pagan temple is destroyed and burned
this is a biblical event

i am an american living in washington
i am so saddened by this horrific event
i cried when i saw the devestation
my heart goes out to the french people and for all the people who share this tiny planet
i mourn the historic and shared loss for all of us
we know that someone did something bad
听不懂
nobody 's notice the cross at 0:46

thought and prayers to notre dame 💓
yah yah yah it does n't even matter
this is definitely staged
haha i hate france
im so sad about this my prayers are with them
bbc 4,000,000 subscribers
oh dear
hi guys a mosque has also been caught on fire in palestine but go off
the only reason why the notre dame cathedral caught fire was because they were recreating a scene from huntchback of notre dame movie
liberal bbc would n't tell you who did it even if they knew
so sad
come to guyana and buy these wood to rebuild
is it the yellow jackets
fuck whoever did that
i see in my dream the sky was covered with god 's war plane
then a lot of people sitting on the beach
and they started throwing stone on the small plane that landed and then they ended up destroying the plane
and the sky is covered with a big plane
we will rebuild and it will stand for longer

my thoughts are with all of france
let all of them burn
i cried
what a tragedy
unlucky
this was not an accident
i tell you who have possibly done this
its those damn atheist
ce trist
ce pierdere imensa
mult curaj franța

太可惜了
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂😂😂😂
that 's sad but the important thing is no one got hurt or died
a blessing is some relics will have survived because there were moved a week before because of the fire
people all around the world have been touched by this tragic loss sending prayers to the people of paris and france
may rebuilding also help rebuild unity of the people
this is a devastating fire
but it does n't surprise me this is what happens when you sell out the people of your country and you lied to them
unfortunately there are probably more bad things coming as an indirect result of all the bs happening in europe and of course france will never admit it because they sold their people out
nope me neither
je voudrais exprimer mes sincères condoléances à la cathédrale notre-dame et à l ’ ensemble de la france
i pet goat ii
👏👏👏

kingdom hearts predicted it
gg
just do n't understand why they did not used helecopter to put out the fire
hope for the future
we heal
we rebuild
i lost almost everything but the clothes on my back to a house fire the path is in not giving up hope
insurance money
luck of respect oh no
that what stays a stone heritage that gives you the fire 🔥 look after the world 's history bless
it would take years and millions to restore it
may the lord bless paris and the world after this loss of a clumsy person
i 'm so heart broken alot of churchs in my city in massachusetts had people gather for prayers
very sad
its a harritage
very painful for franch people
路过
very strange as in the last chapter of the novel the cathedral is set on fire
this lady notre-dame de paris will not remain down
https youtu.be/ct_w2ycpxsi
cette dame notre-dame de paris ne restera pas vaincue
la bonne nouvelle dans tout cela c'est que personne n'est mort dans cet incendie alors que le bois et la pierre peuvent être remplacés voire améliorés malgré les haineux
espérons que le futur toit sera fabriqué si possible en matériau ininflammable comme des poutres en acier et aluminium y compris la flèche et comme un phénix renaissant de ses cendres peut-être même que cette vieille cathédrale pourrait devenir mieux que jamais comme un modèle d'énergie propre et plus respectueux de l'environnement avec une toiture de panneaux solaires nouvelle génération comme un phare sur le monde entier

reporter says the fire started on the roof
wtf what a joke
what was the cause actually
sorry to everyone in france for your loss
a sad but gentle reminder from the heavens above that nothing in this material world lasts forever no matter how badly we want it otherwise whether 2 or 850 years old
❤️
🤣🤣🤣🤣
this is absolutely tragic

who cares
call the pope if you stop the video at 47 a cross appears
so sad silence for notre dame what is with people os syria palestina afrika burn madaf burnnn
let that mf burn

built in 200 years
paris was built around her
and our families grew up with her
but her beauty touches everyone
but the motto of paris also dating from the middle ages is fluctuat nec mergitur → he is beaten by the waves but does not sink
notre-dame will rise again and paris too
thank you for your support your prayers
from france
so do you think the person who started the fire is going to lose his job
😭😭😭😭😭
☹️😥😢
architectural art and history just gone like that

lit
why y'all not talking bout the one in brazil

could it be another false flag to bring in the nwo and one nwo religion
i 'm sadden to see the destruction of such world heritage and relic
so sad😭
my sympathies due to this loss
but seriously folks bbc is fake news
deleterious but not as deleterious as the depravity of mankind
☹️
my god all the history gone
talk about the 12 other church burning in france in the last month
that sucks
just a solid reminder to have excessive fire extinguisher and emergency water sprinklers when you have a place like this
that sucks
amaterasu
this makes the 4th cathedral in france that has been on fire recently
prob something to do with isis
the destruction of notre dame de paris in a sense of regret should not forget that france burned the summer palace in beijing in 1860.a hundred years later the french also felt the pain of a national palace of art being burned down

why is this only being talked about as a building
this is a place of worship
my prayers for all those catholics who are left without their place of worship especially during holy week
of pedastry those wicked catholic monks
and priests sought to conceal through the long dark centuries of popery
i am so saddened by this fire
i am so sorry
they are burning history
0:41
why did n't they use helicopters
amen
i personally hate religions
i 'm a satanist look it up before you call me a devil worshiper
no warning just like a theif in the night
the cross ridicules jesus christ
🇫🇷
i wrote a poem about this
this building that we have adored
but now these flames atop wooden boards
tearing down white marble
and children cry and adults shout
as they watch the giant candle
🇫🇷
quasimodo
people should start a charity to help save the soul of france
arson
rebuild
what on earth could possibly recapture the pure majesty surely not
just my opinion
so no one knows how this started
i ’ m so confused
so sad 850years long history burned
how did it happen
nobody is talking about masjid al aqsa though
“ tempus edax homo edacior ”
open your eyes
🥺
the messiah son of mary was not but a messenger other messengers have passed on before him
and his mother was a supporter of truth
they both used to eat food
wow feel sad for french people
'd
is nobody gon na explain why are n't the smokes black
what could cause that
this is horrible how can it big church like that just burn so quickly and burn at least for half of it i 'm sure it was n't an accident i 'm sure that it was prepared and it was n't just one person that prepared that
we really have to talk about it and jesus christ crown was in there and a lot of things were in there that lasted at least 850 years
this is sad but at least they 're still a jesus cross left that means that there is still hope
keep praying for others and keep thanking god for what you have
shame it was n't all of france in flames
llllllmmmmmmaaaaaooooo what nnnnnnooooooooobbbbbbbssssss
where is quasimodo going to live now
like the reichstag fire which was used to radicalize germany in preparation for ww ii
google larry silverstein building 7
georgia guidestones
what time is cerfew for the alter boys at the father who art in heave alter boy dance night
when the big hand is on the little hand
when is france gon na pay haiti back the gold its owes haiti
superstitious theory they took the gargoyles off for the renovations gargoyles are considered the guardians of the cathedral just a thought
also it 's a sick irony that this would happen when they are renovating
im sorry let 's see here we care about some man made building
common wake up everyone
this is awful to see a history in ruins
a big loss not only for france also for the next generations
there were lighting my sisters candle and some other kids with d.i.pg
😂😂😂😂😂😂
april 15 2019 a war has occurred a battle france is fighting against a fearless opponent
a day in history where in the books it will say not human purposely destroying it it was a fire that we can only watch happen france we are with you and the world will see it become rebuilt thank you you historical building an may the art loss be remembered by our picture as it wo n't be the same
200 years down the drain
even if france goes under and disappears into oblivion no one cares..next
i see millions in money has been pouring in for the restoration job
i understand the building is of historic/cultural importance but other humanitarian projects are crying out for funds its sad the that we lose our priorities
notre dame will be rebuilt it 's a building it will outlive us all
sadly there are people 's lives right now that need more support saddens me how we get our priorities so so wrong
my heart is broken
i even have no chance to visit this place
all history and beauty
pagpalain kayo ng diyos francia
oh no its 9,11 all over again

i wish i could go
sad how did this happen i did n't watch the whole thing yet i hope they find the person that did this if somebody did do it
trying to think positive.chuuuuu
twin towers
this was no renovation accident
usually jesus hates trailer parks and there are tornados
but jesus was mad at the church for child molesters the church has protected
que dieu bénisse tous les chrétiens et les parisiens
rip

who ordered the moving of valuable artefacts the week before the fire
rip
rip
burn hahahahaha.what about the black churches that were burned on march in louisiana the former french territory
875 of france ’ s 42258 have been desecrated vandalised and some even set on fire
11 christians are killed everyday in north africa because of their faith
238 in one weekend in june 2018 nigeria
estimated 900,000 murdered in north africa and the middle east in the last decade
and then they declare notre dame an accident before the fire is even finished and before investors can be let in
shame on all of you
we have been to see it it ’ s absolutely devastating to see it in such a state paris have been through a lot and i would like to pay my respects
why are we worried about something when people in africa are starving who gives to f about the history of that we got people dying and homeless and we worry about this
dont cry
пиздец
let it burn
it is so suspicious to me
how
europe is lost time to cut the rope
oops
condolences from india
la france reconstruira sa cathédrale comme elle s ’ est reconstruite après les révolutions française et les différentes guerres solidarité

i dont get it
why are people upset
the yellow vests are being tear gassed shot water cannoned beaten blinded having their bank accounts closed down and thrown in prison for protesting a living wage while their government pledges billions to rebuild an old church
😎
o no
whodunnit
justice beale is a joke an clearly not fit to hold the position that he does.no wonder domestic violence is on the rise in this country when there is such ridiculous sentences handed down like that shame shame on u beale how do u sleep at night he should be removed from his position immediately what a joke you are
spiritual wars draw close to god.nothing is more important walk with jesus evil and deception abounds
💔

trump seems wall expert 😁
trump is a star
the world soap opera for the sheep do n't let this distract you from venezuela
my god but this man obviously has a problem with the english language
he makes the venezuelan government look like geniuses
he is going to build the wall so that china can increase their exports of ladders to the migrants that will climb over it

so now we have 36 national emergency instead of 35
president xi is a liar he told that they dont have a drug problem
chinese are grabber
install robots with mini guns cheaper then wall
layered defenses the wall/drones/border patrol/and enforcing 10,000 fines for each illegal employed
trump is a builder literally and figuratively

wish we had a leader with the strength of trump in the uk
very few presidents deliver their promises i admire trump for his perseverance
this guy is a crock
building a wall would violate a bill he has just signed into law
22:15 robot donald trump starts to breakdown
😂🤣😝
i dont get it
you just want to do what you want
the wall should ’ ve been built decades ago no matter what administration decided it to be built
god bless america
you either love the man or hate the man i can understand both points of view but so few are willing to empathize with their opposition
guns n gates
we don ’ t need no education all in all it ’ s just another brick in the wall
ladders are going to be used to paint the wall dummy
if our southerns neighbors would get the sh t together
then the wall would be unnecessary
sheesh
trump is the awesomest president ever
usa usa usa

we luv it
why not fix roads help vets help out the people in need
no let 's build a wall instead
‼👍💕
his bills got denied in congress despite the republican majority
both parties did not want the wall
the president used the power of national emergencies to push a bill through
if a democratic president is ever in power now what 's stopping them from doing the same
does n't matter if you do n't have the support of congress you can push anything through
nothing stopping a democratic president from declaring a national emergency on climate change vaccination etc

mexico and canada need to build a wall and the rest of the world will chip in for the lid
end of problem
people will be thinking that it 's silly to hear the president talk about individual cases but it 's every case that stops the rot
they 've forgotten that all of these jobs matter even building a wall that 's something that everyone else has n't got

“ we need to build this lie uh i mean wall ”
look at the security in prisons and we can ’ t even keep drugs from flowing inside our prisons
he has no class no charm no coolness no credibility no compassion no wit no warmth no wisdom no subtlety no sensitivity no self-awareness no humility no honour and no grace
this is a useless comment
thank you mr trump
trump 2020
we need the wall

contain your contribution to global warming with your wall
i fear the supreme court will vote in his favour
our government is a goddam joke
i am only here for the food
build the wall
all
smartass 's do n't have a
family member ☠️ murdered yet
🚩🚩🚩
seems the us uk and russia all have a similar interest in wanting to carve up europe all over again
after 2 years of such poor leadership the us southern border has deteriorated so far that it 's now a national emergency
at least trump realizes what a poor job he 's done
i pity america with this clown president a real pity
since the colonies have a coast guard why not a border guard
gg trump 👌🏻
this drug problem he 's talking about is really creepy
why u cutting off some parts
do n't edit the video
what a joke as a president
weed power
walls are the result of fear and/or greed not courage and compassion
usa has national emergency a russia agent was elected as the president
i 'm running a sale on 35 foot ladders
any illegal aliens interested
pick up in mexico
you carry across desert to trumps wall
quality construction
made in china
whatever the bbc says
i ignore
i 'm never watching or listening to the bbc
they should be showing the people the president trump is asking to stand and be recognized
shame
3:55 febuuuuuuary
this has been an emergency long before donald trump became president
think in your face attitude
this president sounds so lazy
omg
pathetic

hating him wo n't end your problems
build a wall around trump and i 'll pay for it myself
bbc propaganda that it is impartial on anything is an insult to the british people close this bias station down now
this guy is a total joke looooool
you know what
i admire trump here from the uk
i might not agree with all his policies but he speaks his mind and actually does what he says he 's gon na do
if you do n't like what he does then vote him out but at least he 's acting on his words rather than making false promises like our prime minister over here
and the giant humans will re rise from the antarctica and underground caves
cnn 's fake news
it 's an invasion
all obnoxious things from all over the world has set up its headquarters in the us
to reclaim it 's greatness
on all fronts
about freaking time 👏👏👏👍👊
americans will pay for the wall
the fap video that trumptards were hoping for
spineless beeb can not comment
seems like its china 's turn now
makes sense
get the chinese involved
ridiculous
how will mexico pay for it though
please enlighten me someone
well looks like the fascist dictatorship started yesterday
all hail das gropenfuhrer

well done president trump
i wonder why the bbc wo n't report on the senate intelligence agency 's trump/russian collusion report
findings after 2 years no evidence found
it was all a lie
the bbc have pushed these lies for 2 years but wo n't report the committees findings
why
bbc is nothing but fake news for the clueless sheep
gooooooooood
so when will you build a wall up north with canada 's money
president trump is not a good speaker sorry to say kinda feel likes little lost 🤪
6:21 walls work 100 seems like trump has never heard of señor ladder and el tûnnel
build the wall
crime will fall
lunacy
when a man is fired and turns up to work with weapons and starts shooting people is a national emergency
forget the wall..get rid of the guns
decoy
mbga
who tf would even vote for this clown
as a human being we are n't different from each other and the only truth is we are a human being to take care of each other
plosabich and the dishonest media there needs to be a night of the long
knifes to rid our country of these bugs or at lest have the fcc pull
the dishonest fake news broadcast lic
for polluting the air ways with
propaganda
i definitely do n't agree with trump signing that poisonous bill
that bill is worse than anything he has refused in the past

let 's just let our country be overwhelmed by illegals
as tax payers we can afford it
😈
obama will always be my president
prashant no not a trump supporter per say but opposed to socialist oriented traitors in the democrat party here
no better than macron
merkel
trudeau
globalist un
oof
oh look
it 's the israeli news

an embarrassing muddle
it becomes the sightseeing spot if banksy draw a picture
it can keep the security of the illegal immigrant too
as we all know walls work
and leave eu
dealing in truth instead of just chasing money
he makes me believe again
he makes me want to do my part
i just ca n't say enough
brexit👍 maga👍
he sounds like he 's trying to sell himself on what he 's saying
4:41 what happened there
building a wall can not stop drugs gangs and illegal weapons
go mr.president build a tallest and longest wall
i like this guy
walls are made to be broken feel free to use it
i support the wall a strong immigration system and the expulsion of all illegal immigrants convicted of violent or serious crimes
this is a comedy
he made a promise he cant keep
so now he is abusing his power to make a wall that will cost his country a lot of money
he 's actually trying to get it done
he going to need that wall when millions flee north when eliot abrams starts shipping arms to venezuela for the slow coup against the heavily sanctioned people it 's all for oil human rights is the vail
this would n't have happened if the democrats had stopped preventing trump from defending the southern border
the democrats only want illegal aliens for future votes and cheap labour for their business donors
orange man bad
china sold our debt to another country 😂😂😂😂😂
why has n't anyone explained the concept to tariffs to him yet
its insane
i think that this is propaganda for an excuse to bring out martial law on everybody
but why
it ’ s not biased at all
he needs a 🦇 batman opposite himself joker
once that wall is build american humanity will be damaged big and then america will be less and less prosperous till it completley fall
wtf
go back to the closet npcs
you 've lost
0:00-22:15 blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
22:15-22:45 robot trump is malfunctioning
end
all the republicans cheering this just remember that this sets a dangerous precedent
what 's to stop the next president declaring an emergency to subvert congress and get whatever they want passed
trump is actively sabotaging democracy
a wall wo n't stop the invasion shooting them will
the president of the united states is insane
25,45
this is what hitler did was n't it
cut every form of subsidies to illegal aliens in this country
they will go away
buggar the wall
so what does he plan to do
it 'll just take a bit of a planning
hell yeah baby
president theodore roosevelt built panama canal and used the army corps engineers to complete this difficult project
president trump has the duty to protect our border and perhap uses the budget and personnel of the army
second wth i seriously doubt this mexican obsession can be called a national emergency
i mean i know it 's not about the wall but how many times do you beat a dead horse before it 's horse pudding
bbc cnn
at least cnn is funny
😂 what a useless man
joke president
america shot itself in the foot they ’ ll walk with a limp forever
8:46 mmm so due to no barriers 9/11 happened
you can not blame a politician for trying to implement the policies they were elected on
in fact i think it is quite novel
if modi was white 😁😀😀
how about using the money to help mexico and other countries with similar corruption/drug/gun problems
he is not a human being

i hate that someone always blame at others but never reflect themselves
the americans have the drug problems since a long long time ago and these problems all come from one source which is the people in the state that increase the sky-high price of the drugs due to the high demands
building the dumb wall can only do little on preventing the crimes but rising even higher price and value of the drugs in the nation
it is time for these people to deeply reflect on their behaviors of consuming drugs
another acid attack in london i wonder why the bbc forgot to mention it
the american government is absolutely pathetic now
we 've lost our touch..it 's so so sad
🇺🇸💪
this can not be allowed
it sets a precedent that circumvents constitutional law
in the future a national emergency can be declared after a mass shooting and gun control can be forced
or hurricanes continue to devastate the coastal states and a national emergency is declared due to climate change
it 's like there 's something in the water in yankland
erase
i want royal government people on uranus to get some toys from uranus for the boys
mr trump has a ego issue with this wall
oh come on you orange baby
建設新柏林圍牆
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
all brits just keep your mouths shut
keep quiet or you 'll be put in jail for saying something
the humanitarian crisis created by donald trump
monster
stop whitewashing mr president

中国共产党的终级使命就是要打败西方民主推动世界走向共产主义化共产党一定会取得最后的胜利。
we need a british trump a politician that sticks to his word unlike the spineless weasels we have in parliment
中国共产党的终级使命就是要打败西方民主推动世界走向共产主义化共产党一定会取得最后的胜利。
中国共产党的终级使命就是要打败西方民主推动世界走向共产主义化共产党一定会取得最后的胜利。
stupid wall🐷
i wonder if i can have a red hat with the trump name in russian writing
he is an indiot
his supporters are even bigger idiots
trump works for the same banksters who built the wall in israel
trump is just a glove puppet
ice=diet gestapo
the man is literally destroying america so many people being affected by his stupid tariffs
even the hard right in america have turned against him
his damage will be felt in years to come
i 'm going to be signing a national emergency
it is a big con game
every moment he 's allowed to stay in office is the biggest con ever pulled
i just wish he 'd stfu
i ca n't stand to hear him babble
did he just suggest we kill drug users

that sociopath with narcissistic personality disorder did n't even bother to have a speech prepared when he knew he was declaring a national emergency
how can i file for his impeachment
no one else is
he 's going to burn this country to the ground while claiming it 's fake news
i hate that my country is enduring donald trump liar in chief
this has got to be illegal it 's pretty much making him dictator
the shrill voice of the left gets more desperate delusional and insane every day
that is what happens to a mind whose thinking is not based in reality
it gets harder and harder to deny those pesky facts consequences and truths
it gets harder and harder to twist the story no matter how emotional you get
he 's a liar and a scoundal
blablablablablaaablablablablablablaaa
😂😂😂🙈
chi-na
and just like that our constitution means shit i just dont get how he can lie so blatantly and people still clap when he talks
this dude lies about the lies he told before after the other lies he told and so on and
do not pay the tv tax
do not pay to be lied too
the bbc lying by omission manufacturing consent since 1922
he 's probably just angry because he got the rusty water from a trailer park nacho
you know what as of now i wish there was a wall between america and canada because we have a mass influx of undocumented people immigrating from america knowing that they 're going to be deported for being there illegally so now they come to canada exploiting a loophole in our legislation and becoming a drain on our system and my taxes go up as a result
been a crisis for about last 3 years now we 've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it were estimated to start spending in the billion soon and that does n't count the ones we have from syria
i don ’ t agree with everything this president is saying but i agree that illegal immigration is a problem and our borders need to be secured
what 's the presidents plan
i fell asleep at the one minute mark
🤣 this guy is legend
this will pay back
make america stronger
enough of the socialist globalist agendas of those who would undermine our country democrats
mr president is a grumpy trumpy

why does n't he address the mass shootings instead of this political wall
well done president trump
also looking for the apology from the bbc to mr richard tice about brexit party funding ca n't find it anywhere for some reason strange that
now we have no deal brexit and the trump wall
get rid of all the people that uses the drugs that way there 's no drugs coming in if there is nobody buying them think a
go trump

i understand why he wants the wall whether it may be right or wrong
but i can not understand the fact that he forces his vision regardless of other entities of the country
he just forces a one-man vision over a parliament vision which represents current vision of people elected them
american democracy is just failing
trump 2030
he loves talking and manipulating americans
get rid of this son of a btich
god loves trump
this wall is going to be the downfall of the usa
trump/pence campaign
every criminal offense committed to get trump
elected also put pence in the number 2 slot
want trump arrested
impeached
removed from office
if you do n't take pence out of office at the same
time you will end up with something even worse
how is americans have present who talks like this only on issue but in circles
trump supporters are the virus that 's gon na kill america
each day i woke up i thought trump is outed but he still there talking crab
is he talking to children
damn now trump is trying to sing
his lunacy knows no bounds
trump promised a wall in 2016 and the wall will be built
promised kept
california for trump 2020
this man is just rambling
what the hell is be even talking about saying that the us is losing to china
americans do realise that american corporations were the ones who decided that it was cheaper to manufacture abroad and it is n't a question of china stealing anything from american people
furthermore china and other developing countries do n't have such stringent environmental protection laws and worker protections so it 's cheaper for american manufacturers like ivanka trump to manufacture abroad
when is princess ivanka and donald trump gon na bring back their own manufacturing base to the us to maga then

when someone threatens me with let 's say 800 known terrorists released into my territory i do n't consider that person an ally at all
what a bout the pollution water in india
donald trump is a god among men
reason
because you ca n't filter comments and opinions on youtube
they 're just msm pawns in the globalist cabal game of chess
i watch your slow demise with complete and utter satisfaction
blexit 2020 🇺🇸
he never misses the word china in all his statements why
china china chinaaaaaaaaaaa
i do get the feeling that if it was n't for his father 's wealth that he 'd be one of those confused old men who sits on the same stool in the same bar every day of the week and just talks complete nonsense to anybody who else who walks in
a little like barney gumble in the simpsons but without the drink
even the national emergency connected to the 9/11 attacks in the usa declared by president george w bush is still today officially going on because president obama and president trump have both continued it
greetings from northern europe from partly arctic finland
just a thought
has he driven along the freeways between our usa and mexico
god bless president trump and the people of the usa ❤️
that 's what this is about for the mobster and conman in chief you 've heard of hadrian 's wall
well donald imagines the trump wall
it 's that simple
way to go mr
president

there 's a terrorist standing in front of white house
what does the military plan to do about this
islaam is a demon among human being
too many same same presidents make life boring
horrible
you build a wall around your house to defend your family but building a wall around your country is unacceptable
could be at a doctors surgery waiting on news of the baby
seems a bbc producer has said on twitter that the story about the gas attack in syria was surprise suprise a false flag story pushed by fake news main media the bbc is a joke
i am british i have to say well done trump
as a mexican take that who will end up with the bill
who 's gon na pay for the wall
let 's build the wall desecrate mountain s change course of rivers and so on
i thought trump is different but that is not true
he is the reincarnation of nixon reagan bush clinton and obama
there is no difference
chinese fentanyl and home cooked meth wo n't be coming over the mexican border anymore
i feel safer already
getting it done
do you remember that episode of the simpsons where homer 's brother puts him in charge of his company and he builds a bubble dome car and bankrupts him
this reminds me of that
amerifats put this idiot in charge and he 's literally going to build a giant wall and bankrupt you ha ha ha
we know who like to “ invade ”
us hypocrisis is unbelievable
well there are always 2 sides to a coin today you are building a wall to keep the 'trash out
on the flipside you could be building the wall to lock yourselves in
food for thought
trump does n't care if the wall works or not
he does n't care what it costs or who pays for it
he does n't even care that it was a promise to anyone he never has
it has always been about his giant ego
he is fighting for the biggest presidential monument of all time
now he will waste more money on a tantrum inspired national emergency which will thankfully have funding tied up in court well past 2020 and if there is any hope for this country at all we will be rid of that useless conman by then
the economy is horrible
wages are not only stagnant but have decreased in some areas
a middle class armed with cash is the strongest engine of economy
everyone within reason who is actively seeking work can find a fulltime job if they choose to
i don ’ t have a view on the last
i mean every country has some laughable leaders but this guy trumps them all
use the billions from china to build your pointless wall
why does he have to brag about everything
he is obnoxious
no bozo they 're laughing at you
know that supreme court in constitution only given authority to decide constitutionality not a lower court
so until supreme court decides why does equal executive 1 of 3 branches honor/enforce obvious unconstitutional lower court rulings
the communist china
haha trump is a bad joke
why would you even vote for this stupid man
i pity america for this
did president trump just sell our country down the drain today
he had a chance to become a king david or a king saul
i believe now he is king saul
how sad
he sold out
did he listen to his daughter and son-in-law who are liberal communist anyway this is a sad day for america
trump did not even read the 1,100 pages and he just took mcconnell 's word for it
the democrats got all they want
and now the invasion begins with all the illegals
sad day in america
what happened to mr trump
did they threaten him
trump was very different today when he made that speech i think he knew he made the wrong choice but did it anyway😵😵😩😖😩😩😩
eradicate the problem like the uk
we had a gun problem after ww2 we set up laws to stop gun crime
get rid of guns we get less than 23 gun related murders per year
the wall is currently getting built at this moment its way too late for complaints
so your comments is failure and i do add the word flawlessly
no matter what reply comes afterwards
trump declares national emergency says i did n't need to do this then leaves to go to his florida golf resort where he charges the taxpayer
trump has not even appropriated the private land he needs to build his wall he is hoping to use eminent domain like he tried and failed to do when an old lady would not sell him the land he needed to build a limo parking lot at his casino which also failed
july 25 2011 the national emergency with respect to blocking property of transnational criminals was in response to the rise in crime by specific organizations los zetas mexico the brothers ’ circle former soviet union countries the yakuza japan and the camorra italy
may 16 2012 the national emergency with respect to blocking property of persons threatening the peace security or stability of yemen addressed political unrest within the yemen government
nov 23 2015 the national emergency with respect to blocking property of certain persons contributing to the situation in burundi was declared after a failed coup

the american-mexico border is about 2,000 miles long and with overruns will probably cost the american taxpayer about 80 90 billions of dollars plus and will be plagued with multiple problems and drawbacks
is this wall an actual necessity or is it merely trump ’ s folly
two years late
thank you president trump
build the wall
drain the swamp
maga
talk about drugs when usa have like what 5 6 states with farms growing marijuana the only real drug here is that feeling you people have to bring and create what hate racist labels ideas and options to register regretion of peace you people have a lot of issues and it 's rather talk discuss stead of solution negotiations the only invation is your on demons like fear the wall will not protect you from yourself lier bully overall high addict so high you think you created the economy that you have jajajaja they were your ancestors not you with them you are nothing and litarelly you are taking all creation to nothing to destruction maybe sad world sad politics
the ego
it is weird how he argues with himself
i think maybe i am princess juliet of aldebaran a
the aldebaranian a empire is aldebaran a uranus and another planet
i think maybe i have 2 sons with a hispanic man
i want the royal government people on uranus to get some toys from uranus for the 2 boys
he is a disaster he is eirdt than nixon
lol it 's not going to do anything 😂😂😂😂😂😂 what an idiot and democrats are stupid for giving him the money because he declared it anyway
who cares
the usa is in danger because of this embarrassing fake president
the only national emergency is trump himself
get this dumbcunt out of office now
the greatest most dangerous example of obsessive compulsive disorder i 've ever heard anyone suffering from this crazy man suffers from
and we the citizens must suffer as well under his illness
unbelievable

china
china
china
china
trump
bbc involved in using a military grades acoustic device to inflict brain damage in a british man.they do it for the hated prince charles the exploitation of a man by psychological campaign to dehumanising destruction by violence with acoustic devices.the government scientist involved establishment doing toxic poisonous violence with acoustic devices that is the british establishment human rights crime.i see a future of yellow shirts in the uk.human brain experiments without consent using acoustic devices frequencies were not normally exposed to like being hit with a physical weapon to the left side of the brain with added autosuggestions.come from from the shadows face courts television and establishment rapist
can someone please send him to bed
he ’ s obviously tired he ’ s making no sense
something iv e noticed about trump when he 's speaking on any subject at all..its not about the nation or the people..it 's always about himself
even to the point of taking credit for things he had nothing to do with
it 's like watching american 'reality tv
almost an impersonation of mussolini even up to the infamous 'bullfrog pose'..and they actually believe him they cheer and yell things like maga and scream his name over and over
tells me an awful lot about certain types of americans lost to reality
one thing i ca n't ignore about trumpet and ca n't get past why does he buy his suits too large
i 'm drunk
so very very drunk
the wall must be built to keep out the allahmonkeys and the ignorant peons
😐😐
jesus christ
will somebody please shoot this madman put a bullet in his head
amen
well done trump those liberals that think illegal immigration is okay must be crying into their cereals now
america get rid of this utter muppet its like team america came to life ha ha
😲
this man just did the unthinkable and it 's shameful
this by far is the worst president in history😵😠😠
this person is the stupidest person does he realize mexico can make tunnels ladders and planes
usa has the worst president than ever before
annoying phrase “ ever before ”
how embarrassing
what a psychopath trump is
educate yourselves on psychopaths
google the pcl-r by dr robert hare
planning something big are ya
oh and another thing from a reliable source says that apparently 150 immigrants coming to us from mexico randomly got killed
it was very gruesome from what i was told what state they found the immigrants in
sources say that reptillians had a play in their gruesome murder
my iq just dropped 50 points
trump wants a wall like in ba sing se if you watch avatar you will know what i mean
like president trump
and you wonder why the usa ca n't even make the top-ten most-free countries anymore
your days are over america
my word
ever
as well as to fact based reasoning rational thought common sense basic human decency to attention span that has ever crawled outta his daddies
yet morons will still chant supreme leader trump in 2020
hurryupmueller
i am glad he did this the whole stupid wall is his and the american people will be paying for it forever 5 billion make it 50 billion
people talking about steps and ladders being used on mexicos side have you thought about what happens to your fkn legs when you fall over 30 feet
little kid got hurt badly just from falling from an old section that was n't as tall as it is now
this guy is a legend
savor every moment he is your president
how about you all get over the fact that you don ’ t like trump and just see the bigger picture
he cares about the american people and our safety unlike liberals
i dnt get how building wall can stop illegal mexicans coming in
they have ladder nd ofcrs they can break the wall
😂 it will just waste lots of money of americans
if drugs and human trafficking is a problem then improve ur laws nd security
hey mr trump
take your followers and murderers and ur big friend blair ofc and go to moon
no need for walls there
dickhead
the wall of the hate and division
i am so sorry that the world is leaded by such a pathetic man
he s bringing hate fear division and stupidity to the world
he respects a man that got 1.5 million people aressted because of their religion
money money moeny money bye bye to ethics people with guys like this in charge
china 's economy is on a different level now thoes guys are untouchable
its a plan by the brown invaders to swarm the southwest so that hispanics can overwhelm the populace and vote the southwest back to mexico
invaders not immigrants
israhells wall should be taken down as this is not the ashkenazi 's place of origin
all the idiots that think that other ppls lands are for the neandrathals barbarians pale faces have another thing coming
trump trump trump
national emergency is us prison systems and the student loan scam
he does n't speak like president like seriously he think being president is a normal thing and you could speak whatever you like but it 's not you represent your country and prepare yourself like a president
believe in the only one god come on we will going back to origin place of adam and eve eternal life in heaven only by believe in one god allah the almighty
how can anyone listen to this garbage and not laugh
in the future replays of trump 's nonsense will be the basis for a quiz show
you listen to the answers and guess the questions
get the chineses to build the wall and ship over they can do it cheaper
imagine your window is broken and you wake up and there 's 100 people in your house in your kitchen and living room
is fixing your window a problem
if you wanted to fix your own window liberals would be screaming at you and calling you insane
let ’ s watch all the idiots cry because schumer and pelosi were unable to stop trump building the wall
go to the middle east
so this dimwit thinks that woman and girls are trafficked by crossing the border on foot
how is a wall going to stop the under ground tunnels and how is it going to stop drugs from being transported cause its not being transported by illegals on foot
this dude is weird
now let the elected president fulfill his stated campaign promise as so many have failed to do in the past

http therealnewsnowadays.us/why-europe-has-dodged-americas-fentanyl-crisis
we will have a national emergency
i guess you can organised emergencies
if you 're none of 'em and still being supported from someone within developed nations then try to understand that something is not right
i know if you 're uneducated then how would you get my point

the bbc is lying
there are already 31 national emergencies in place that every existing president must sign on to every six months to keep them active which they have
it is not rare to declare a state of national emergency
they said nothing about it when trump declared a state of national emergency in dec of 2017 did they
i wish we had him as our prime minister
instead we have a week woman in charge
these drug traffickers should be given the death penalty
or dig a tunnel or just climb over it eather way we are still gon na get over it
there is a thing called a catapult 😂😂
all walls work dude tryfinding example
i 'm in texas
obama and pelosi wanted a wall years ago but coward-out
protect our borders
that 's why you were elected
god bless america
🇺🇸🇺🇸
who knows what that means
what a stupid uneducated thing to say
us-uk trade deal gon na increase trade
oh god not more luminous drinks
we have had all those bases covered a long time now but when you dismantle all your factories and move them to china and you put all your patented stuff in the factories it 's going to get out
everything is for sale now
trump will be going to hanoi
i hope so
all lies all the time
distraction from msm every day all trump all the time while the country is destroyed
the usa was taken over by a criminal cabal that is destroying the country
day after day the news is trump the scumbag trump the idiot trump the criminal trump the crazy person trump the demented trump the drug addict trump the racist trump the misogynist trump the liar trump the traitor trump the philanderer trump the pervert trump the slacker
not one thing has been done about trump
he is not a president
he is an agent of the plutocracy destroying the country
the government trump can declare a national emergency and take over the country dictator for life and no one will do anything about it
he is proof there is no god
😂🤣🤣🤣
like the stable genius he is he said he was getting his wall and walla
walls work jim
trump 2020 🇬🇧🇺🇸
everyone crying a river over a real national emergency that will only cost 8 billion meanwhile everyone has amnesia over obama giving iran 150 billion cash for absolutely no reason what so ever
every time he says china i want to punch my screen
unfortunately this maniacal psychotic is not just an absolute national embarrassment but even internationally

it turns out you can put words in any order you want
🎶 china china china china china china china 🎶
trump 2020
who knows what that means
when talking about relationship and trade deals with china
oh my gawd
he is such an idiot
so he basically made the wall stuck in years of litigation
if the illegals bring ladders we bring boiling oil
well done trump 💪
build the wall 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺
the bbc are to be exposed next week by tommy robinson
i did not vote for trump but have been amazed by what he has gotten done
donaldus maximus build the wall
trumps wall will put an end to the democrats supply chains
death penalty for people that use drugs

this is the man you voted for america
sad very very sad
rambling
i believe president trump is the cyrus of isaiah 45

this clown is pitiful
he cant say february
febwah
he kept his campaign promises not like obama
waffle waffle waffle i 'm the mad sicko i can do what i want la la la la
the wall will protect americans against illegal alien invasions criminal and terrorist invasions and dangerous drug smuggling even during democrat administrations
who could be against that
empathy belongs with u.s children parents and others victimized from crimes committed by illegal aliens not the illegal aliens
pink floyd the wall.trump rocks
ca n't wait for tommy robinson 's documentary
the 'well they can just use ladders 'argument is nonsensical
do the individuals making that argument suppose that every or even most individuals who would have illegally immigrated would a even attempt the migration knowing that there is a massive wall or b bring a ladder with them
anyone who argues that a wall would have no impact in reducing illegal immigration is being disingenuous
pakistan ki maa ka bhosda
its not a wall guys its a fence
i want to know how our president ruined our country because we are thriving woot woot trump 2020
we build the us border wall
my iq man delete this video off of youtube man
it just hurts my head
i ca n't even with this
biased bbc
lock her up
red castle green castle it has always been the plan
the only people who have not expected this over the last year are the sheep who swallow the propaganda bull crap shoveled at them on a daily basis
we knew it we observe its progress
we approve
we also approve the coming trials and look forward to seeing the perp-walks for the corrupt criminal elite which has infiltrated our government over the decades and undermined our nation
you no longer support the freedoms and governance you once did and you have become a suicidal hell hole of fascist totalitarian self destruction
you have become the threat you once fought
if you dont get your ruinous corrupt and out of control govt back under control we are going to have pull out and get ready for the next world war one in which you will not be an ally of ours
you are in the process of being conquered by psychopathic criminals and are simply standing by waiting to be their cannon fodder in some kind of sick conviction that being a passive and cooperative victim of truly evil and demented elites is the very best you can possibly be
to hell with that and to hell with you
get your crap together or lose it
take back your nation

when bbc spends all day deleting pro trump comments
look at the like to dislike ratio on this video
morons
president trump for 2020
american paranoid is terrible like 800 american military bases invading other countries sanctions to anti dollar countries
walls surrounded every part of usa
bbc is fake news
1st
22 5 ma boi trump freestylin
demorats on panic mode
please comment below
the wall is too keep americans in
trump will make america poor again
a lot of brainless npcs in the comment section here
the wall should have been up since the 70s
anyone who thinks the wall wo n't work has no clue about the horrors that occur in mexico
just a bunch of npcs on auto-pilot
very sad
the fake media are a disgrace
the democrats blocked stalled delayed not compromised or tried to help the border issue
they knew that this would lead to the president declaring a national emergency
this helps the democrats in the 2020 elections
to assist them are the fake media spewing out the usual propaganda
corruption and money
please vote for president trump 2020
i 'm 1
damn even he does n't believes the lies he tells anymore and here goes the shit show with his national emergency
npcs are malfunctioning in the comment section
ohk yeah he lies
pelosi is gon na grab him by his wall
maga
no one respect usa with trump or without him
you have to wonder what he thinks his presidential accomplishments will be

Hurricane michael
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
hold my beer whilst i keep this glass door shut
sorry for the loss of people stuff
i had a bf named michael and he was a disaster so this makes sense
america become like syria kkkkk bless syria
mexico will pay for the damages
i would n't wan na be gang groomed in that
the angry version of mother nature
the destroyer 😱
looks like people did n't pray hard enough
god bless world
nice video but bad news
forget thoughts and prayers try donating money to the red cross/crescent save the children or unicef
nature doesn ’ t give af
andrew was way more destructive
subhan allah toba allah
meanwhile i 'm stuck in america which is being run by a rabid orangutan enabled by a gruop of chimpanzees who say that this hurricane was a hoax
ᴩʟᴇᴀꜱᴇ ꜱᴇɴᴅ ʜᴇʟᴩ
clearly this is just a fake place with fake news
luan
bbc shields a schizophrenia weapon user who has stolen a mans life inflicting mental illnesses to deliberately torture
absolutely awful
bbc is fake news
oh
سبحان الله
الحمد لله الذي عافانا مما ابتلاهم به
that 's windy
god bless the people of this region
man made
un weather weapons
😤 this is donald trump 's fault
😤
on trump time he gets the credit
canadian trees would have stayed standing in that little breeze
its a learning opportunity
seems like two different world now
we should not spend one dime in relief on these lazy hurricane survivors
they made there choices
lololol
hurricane food relief and bottled water welfare queens 😂
this is terrible
it 's rick scott 's katrina
the same goes for trump
trump 's off having a far-right rally with our tax dollars and americans in fl are in a life and death situation
it 's just like bush with katrina
basically at the beginning it was just read my lips
it is gods way
not just leave them out in the cold because it can happen to us by things like this that are out of mans control but do humans ever learn to understand the simplicity of the message of the wrath
when will this un equal world change
je vois

Bush eulogy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
wow the comments are sick
don ’ t scroll down
no matter what you think of either of these men it ’ s sad to watch a man bury his father
bill clinton looked suspiciously uncomfortable during the 'lady of the night gag
he will face justice in front of must god
for his unjust things he did in his life
goodbye george hw bush
no idea why i was surprised to see dirty comments
faceless and nameless weakling
mr bush jr 's eulogy was so emotional
i edited it on my channel
have a look please
breaking news former civil servant i.e 41st potus dies
who gives a fook lolll awful person that deserves no respect
damn i thought it was you not your dad 😑
anyways
i need subtitles for this video
whats in the box
rip
one less globalists to worry about 😂








that eye-dagger he shot toward trump when speaking of integrity 10:43 could have cut diamonds
well done
god bless his soul our condolences
as a french i have to admit that his eulogy was very emotional
we disagreed on iraq war but we always have been allied
god bless our american brothers 🇺🇸 🇫🇷 ♥️♥️
well done george w ♥️
i am drunk as fhck
yo kissinger you 're next
wish i had a speed boat 🙄
eulogy to a psychopath
rest in peace mr president
dont cry bush he was 94
prescott bush 👁️
george w bush will outlive his father if he lives until christmas day 2040

life is vanity
at the end of the day we are all human beings
we all have hearts
we all breathe the same air we all die we are on this planet together and it 's sad to admit that we do n't treat our fellow human beings with respect or love anymore
all that being said he was also your president
i enjoy being in the states in arizona for a month when our winter is the worst here in alberta so i like to keep up with politics
their are millions of other videos hating on him go do it there
this is n't the time or the place
not one of you would be able to walk up to any of these people here and say to their face all the crap you guys have been spewing all over the comment section
be an adult you do n't need to hide behind your keyboard
if you would n't say something to the persons face if you would n't say it in front of his family do n't say it online
just a bit of a coward move in my opinion
anther criminal funeral
rest in peace 💯🏴🏴🏴🏴
you 'll be in a coffin soon enough you war criminal
you honored your father mr president
our hearts broke with you and your family
and he is indeed with you sister and mom

小布什每次都很搞笑

my graveside wo n't need 24/7 guards to stop ppl from defecating on my grave as the bushes do
ghwb had the pleasure of being reunited in the afterlife with robin and barbara to look forward to but eternity is a long time to be haunted by the ghosts of john and robert
the crucified usa
i hope he joins his dad in hell soon
i cried in the end
i lost my puppy and my wish of going to heaven is to see her again
i might not be a fan of any of those people either but why do you guys have to be so cancerous
know your abode is fire and fury.for eternal
you killed people thinking you are gon na live forever.murderer
why does n't bush do a eulogy for all the dead iraqis he caused for his oil tycoon
they can both rot in hell where they belong
bbc is fake news
a war criminal has gone
kudos to the courage to face the loss of dear ones
got a lot to learn from this speech and there comes last 60 seconds 12:00 indeed heavy to handle rip mr george hw bush
look at trump 's face
like father like son.i would never have believed that war crimes ran in the family
it hurts so deep to lose mom and dad
how did jeb get an invitation to this event
dear bbc why are you burying real news to cover the funeral of an evil man
i remember the only slipper was thrown😃
trump looks like he is taken a dump 😍😀😃😄😜
🇺🇸 usa
murderers
who was the person in the robe and the wizard stick
how about world trade centre

i thought that george bush died not his father well now i know

you can crack a joke and show a sense of humor in your father 's funeral without being disrespectful

r i p h w bush may god forgive his sins what he did as a human and as a president of united states
300 million americans and its skull and bones members again and again
both son and father was a terrorist
rip ☺
bbc worse than cnn
i ’ m on the highway to hell🔥🔥🔥
a criminel paying tribute to his criminal father
i 'm sorry for the family 's loss of course but i can never forget the appalling atrocities that man has caused
all those vulnerable women children whose lives have been destroyed forever and all the lives taken by his actions those are the people my love sympathy are with
i know also that i should n't talk ill of the dead so i wo n't
this is what i 've come up with
i 'm on a fools errand
kill them
no better murder them
never leave the supporters
illuminati elite
bush family thank you kosovo kid thank you and with my albanians brother rip president
god curse america
rip you are now bush food
i wonder if he 's still worshipping satan
the ex-ruler of usa speaking of his late father all the good is being praised but the gruesome reality is swept under the royal carpet
histories are written with reams of lies this is what is entrenched in the people of usa the people of the world lies
peace out
🦀🦀🦀🦀
thật tuyệt vời
truly they have shown both leadership class in inviting president melania trump to attend the memorial
blessings to the current pres
also to all of our former pres
their families
elected by the people and they kept world peace every president in the church.unlike the uk head of state and her hereditary replacement through the british democratic deficit
looking at all these comments below just shows me the true power of evil
evil breeds more evil
our culture of negativity paranoia hate war greed conspiracy etc it all starts up at the top and trickles down to the citizens below
it takes a strong mind to not let your soul become full of hate
i did not vote for either bush and i despised their policies
you people celebrating your hatred of the man upon his death are equally as fucked up
the bush dynasty is over
the deaths of millions are on their hands
and they will pay
in this life the next
may allah swt thrust him in the deepest part of hell for s all the evil committed from this evil person and those with him against muslim world where he has gone none can help him know except allah swt
evil
weg damit und den rest auch
evil followers gathered soon your turn g bush dog
hope he burns in hell
prescott bush was a nazi collaborator with union bank
kabbale..soooo criminal
es lebe trump

i can ’ t believe how disrespectful people are is this seriously the world we ’ re living in
someone dies that you don ’ t like so you tell them to “ rot in hell ”
that ’ s pathetic
and thus lucifer welcomes another to the pits of hell to suffer a personal torment until the ends of eternity


war mongering skull and bones member sending off another war mongering skull and bones member
i respect everyone in that room because there human if i agree with them or not does not matter
sorry for poor grammar i suck at grammar

reptilcans
another devil going up to speak
that beaded eye devil
hope trump rectify by the sermons
the rest of the bush family should jump in before they fill the hole
didn ’ t know he could read
haters always ganna hate

war criminals convention
helped assassinate jfk
and betrayed his men in the military and let them die
thats how he ended up on a raft in the ocean
he just ditched the plane he was flying with men on board without any warning and everyone on board except george hw bush died
thank god he is dead
do n't feel sorry for him
god this has just made me realise i will have to do this one day
i 'm going to give my dad a big hug next time i see him
r.i.p
awww so sad to see a war criminal go unpunished
rip
irony of commenters labelling bush as the devil when they spew nothing but death violence and hatred
i have no doubt all you guys would be the pigs in animal farm
please respect the man funeral even if 'if he was evil bashing his funeral makes you the same
i am not sure if he can think about tens of thousands of people who loss their relatives and beloveds because of him and his father
brings back some nostalgic feelings as bush jr speaks
rest in peace r.i.p
george i destroyed the twin towers w bush
this is a satanic ceremony dressed up as christianity
war criminal
thank god he 's dead
u.s oligarchs
trump the only man in that room not part of the globalist project
you killed millions people war criminal father and son go to hell 🔥🔥🔥🔥👺👹👹👺👹👺👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹
