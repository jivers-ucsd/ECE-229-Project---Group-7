the reporter calls it fact check lol
creepy joe
seriously democrats this guy is corrupted
dude
just quit now
as a firefighter i would never vote for you
i guess i ’ m just a deplorable firefighter
🇺🇸
guess cbs and the communist loving unions have no problem with binden bragging at a council on foreign relations meeting about using 1 billion yes billion with a b of us taxpayer dollars to threaten the ukrainian government into firing a prosecutor who was looking into a corrupt business involving biden 's son
biden told the ukraine they had 6 hours to fire the prosecutor otherwise they would lose 1 billion in foreign aid
the ukrainians folded and fired the prosecutor and got their billion dollars of taxpayer money
i 've been watching that speech for about an hour
there 's still a lot of losers out there that think the tax payers should take care of them and joe is whipping them into a frenzy with his collection of woe is me parables and fables
just keep your sons and daughters home
all this democrats..do is talk and trash trump nothing about how they will help americans..no plan nothing..just plain hatred of the president im afraid they will pay the price again in 2020
especially now with this creep
bellend
with all that talk will he donate his salary as president to a cause or two
fake news at it again
propaganda machine
joe bidens son colluded with ukraine oil cartel was put on board and charged fake consulting fees
¡creepy uncle joe vale pura mierda
latinos4trump2020
suicide
biden
na
now if biden and the tactics of traditional touching and tolerance arent respected in ways that the corrupt dnc demand he can try to remind audience interests just how critical to democracy and security the brennan comey strzok ohr and avenatti teams were and will be again if these damn tea party terrorists and russian bots would stop trying to hijack the consensus
i dont think hes even sweating the career independents eventual appeasement
everyone hates biden except for the media
every democrat failed trump
what has biden done for firefighters
stuff and he 's a guy
keep the energy going biden don ’ t lag

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wall
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
want a fun drinking game
i 'll meet you at the hospital
he talks like a 5th grader
i guess mexico is n't paying for it
i 'm reading these comments and some of you have never experienced common sense and it shows

so who fact checks the fact checkers
not agreeing or disagreeing with them but these fact checks by biased news media sources are meaningless
do people around this pusillanimous orange flummery have any idea of how stupid he makes america look
sorry i fell asleep during his speech
hey donnie
you could always burn down the reichstag 's and declare a national emergency oh wait
lord jesus here we go
no matter how tall and indestructible the wall is people will just turn to underground tunnels to smuggle in
walls work 100 percent
tell that to el chapo and his tunnels
the insanity in his rambling is so obvious that if you do not see it you should see a doctor
trump thinks a veto proof majority in both houses is a national emergency
1 rising/conquering stage
2 prosperity/innovation/power
3 comfort/security/contentment
4 boredom/complacency/laziness
5 stupidity
6 collapse
anybody else get that horrible feeling like we 've made it to stage 5
why did this guy cut in while trump was speaking 56:05
donald trump
god bless him
i thought all the drug trafficking stopped after locking up chapo guzman

so that 's why trump beefed up the military budget
bigot fool
hit the wall 👀🤣😂
build the security wall
god bless president donald j trump '45
the strangest thing about this is not only the hypocrisy on his part but also this goes against one of the core conservative principles
smaller government
in order to have order you need boundaries
build the wall
trump 2020
emergency
we ’ re out of milk
and we need a wall

they go around the wall and in 🤣🤣🤣
we are here to hear the president
thumbs down
pos would interrupt the president during his speech
anyone that is against it lacks common sense
trumps wall is symbolic of the west rejecting globalism and corporatism which is why the msm and washington elite are so opposed to it
melania 's parents are in this country because of 'chain migration
20:35 shuut up trump is still talking
alright guys the wall is happening and it is happening to keep us all in
does this man ever think before he opens his mouth
🤔🤔🤔😳😳😳
dear youtube
the problem is i hate the president so much
i was not even allowed to respond
why
build the walllllllllll

tallest tower falls just like the babylon towers
allways trying to underestimate ignored the rights of this hard working family abuse her entirely she will squash all into it all over usa and the world un it
thank you president trump 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
trump 2020

if i ran a country you do run a country
who do you think you 're fooling
who do you think you 're fooling
keep doing your thing dude
does anyone know the annual follow-up costs
such a structure must be maintained
putting hand in the cookie jar
this guy knows con games
non-negotiating nancy and her shadow schumer need to step down
they can not do their job
some say rambling i say plain talk without help
to serve and protect
not trump ’ s wall
our wall
see ya in 2020 trump
can ’ t wait to see their tears for round two😂he ’ s so racist though🤣
congress passes spending bills
52:44 declares national emergency
i thought that how democracy works is by the people electing a president who then has a mandate for his policies
impeachyay umptray

are u kidding uk hates u
who is that

hopefully all attendees were entertained by that old dimwit 's vapid grandfather stories
such ignoble diabolical cunning to use other people 's sufferings as clickbait for personal agenda

trump

emergency declaration starts at 5:48
i believe that truth
what about when they are not stopped
got ta protect this man
the cartels are ruthless
usa usa usa
this is hard to watch
fentanol chiner obby
these are ofensive racial hour long speech
ww3 is only inevitable
red castle green castle
please come to west-europe and make a stop to the problems we 're having
the insanity starts at about 36:40
what a disjointed rambling mess
anons already knew
reuters on china
so mad trump keeps winning
cartels control the border and the politicians in the area
el chapo will pay for the wall
the wall is to let people in
impeachment imminent
🙄🙄where is his wife and where is pence lmbo
nancy knows it chuck knows it they all know it
under funded schools and citizens without medical coverage those are state of emergency
a fricken wall is a con man joke
poor tax payers paying the bill cause the wealthy got the tax breaks funny if it wasn ’ t so sad
why does trump breath soo loud..🤔🤔
the rambling of an unhinged idiot is always painful to see but as potus absolutely tragic
el chapo card about to be tossed in
border not a natl emergency climate change is
as a matter of fact according to gore the world should have already ended
so it 's not the invasion of illegals
we should all take our unicorns 🦄 to work today not your foreign made vehicle
he 's taking money from the military and other national recovery systems weakening us for an attack from russia
the liar-in-chief at it again
somebody is gon na rock his neck
i hope so

you know that tripled spaced grade four reading level pile of papers in front of him paper actually said gang members not gang monsters the man can not read
1:00:44
mexico shouldve built a wall back when the gringos were migrating there
the wall not is for the imigrations the wall is to protection to the comunism
rusia-china-mex
springfield has had his monorail let him his wall
we 'll visit it to remember how stupid they where
donald trump 's give up on that wall this is unnecessary
gop thinks the earth is flat
the vast majority either do not want a wall or do n't care
we must not make decisions based on off the cuff remarks
mr trump 's remarks are not based in fact
death penalty for drug dealers
get it done mr president
trump just submitted a national emergency declaration saying he 's changing the national anthem from the star-spangled banner to pink floyd 's we do n't need no education
both 'do n't and 'education will be misspelled
since trump has already previously declared opioids a national emergency should n't that already give him the power to build a wall to stop the opioids
clinton bush obama all declared national emergency
i did n't need to do this but i wanted it done faster
facepalm remember those words
how can he justify taking money from the military
that money is supposed to go towards housing repairs hanger repairs dock repairs etc
so does this mean none of those things will get done
build the wall
maga

impeachment is the only remedy for an illegitimate corrupt sociopathic potus
the house and senate are now obsolete redundant
for the gullible and self ignorant the constitution just became simply a piece
con un abogado porque soy víctima
this lady has no clue
when it 's all said and done he will have his wall
regardless of what people think and say as long as his base backs him it 's as good as done
walls do n't stop drug cartels
lmfao 🤣
i dont belive you
maga
we the people are waking up
we got a caricature of poop that talks sitting in the white house
so this idiot will declare a national emergency for a wall but wo n't even entertain the thought of funding for health coverage
what are we doing here
i think the chemicals within the adhesive he uses on his toupee are getting to his brain
how did the wall in berlin work
ha ha ha trump hit pelosi over her empty head and snatched her purse
lmfao
sniff
any person who uses a term undocumented immigrants is guilty of inciting the foreigners to invade and brake the law
unbelievable
even if he gets two terms that wall will be held up in dozens of courts while he 's in office
he looked like he had an issue walking to the lectern
lying doctors

thank you trump for sticking up for these victimised women and children who have become victims in trafficking
i have yet to hear other politicians speak about it
yo no vivo enadera califormoa lo
testifico
con el poder nuestro padre.celestial amen
who cares one way or the other
qin shi huang ever heard of him
it did n't work then
the list of dynasties is very long qi
su ming
a russian spy and his red sparrow wife

36:28 start there
0:21:11 and he 's still rambling over watching sicario part 2
he 's losing it mentally
americans are so tired of this anti-president trump anti-american rhetoric
let trump have 8 billion that is a small price to pay for the next democrat president to declare climate change and gun violence as national emergencies
built the wall so we can trump 2020
this just made my day
40:55 hey look its that rude clown jim
bargaining
i hate how they say his boarder wall
it 's not his
i did n't vote for him
but i hate liberal media pushing their agenda by saying his
yes
spanky 's a national disgrace
trump stopped the illuminati and saved the world keep him going and use your brain
i ca n't wait to see the bundys face off with federal marshalls sent by trump to enforce the governmet taking of a republican rancher 's land
president chicken little
criminals and drugs
i am so tired of this repetitive rhetoric
yet we can trust cbs statistics
rather be wrong and go down with trump then the status quo of the last 30 years or so
barbed wire to stop weman who have been abducted and taped up what a hero
we are going backwards under trump
cbs what tools to break in and interrupt the press conference
they are so biased they are bought and paid for by the democrats
why when i hover the cursor over the video 's play bar do i see trump talking but when i click it all i get is these cnn jackasses
36:40 those numbers though
does he realize he has just approved of something that president obama did by taking anything credited to obama and incorporating into his national emergency
and his “ impression ” of the president of china was that necessary
thank you president donald trump

cbsn is lousey news because so much you say is fake fake fake
maga
today ’ s national emergency is the wall but 2020 is coming
trump is a national disaster
well you can tell the political orientation of cbsn by how they started the video with propaganda and cherry picked data on behalf of illegal non-americans
in 2000 illegal border crossing were at a rate of 1 million that year
yes
illegal crossings are down to 400,000 this year but has increased from last year that is the population of miami omaha or raleigh crossing over in a year
over 22 million illegals are in the country
that is larger than the population of florida
who makes money from it
corporations that donate to politicians hospitals that are paid by us the tax payers it goes on and on
like walmart having the government actually subsidize healthcare for its workers
who makes money
who foots the bill
the middle class
if you do not feel the pinch in your wallets your lifestyle as middle class citizens your crazy
that does n't take in consideration all the h1b visas that get lower income tech workers to replace u.s workers
do n't believe it
look at what disney did to their workers
they are n't in a lot of cases relinquishing any of their culture having us
look at somalis in minnesota or muslims in dearborne mi
their rules not ours
so indeed there is a crisis and i want reporters like acosta to quit lying because they are controlled by the corporations that benefit
follow the money not the news
his breathing bothers me
what an idiot drugs are not coming through where there is no fence
but rather through the ports
cbs is a joke
the attempted coup has failed miserably
time to pay the piper
it turns out the liberalism is truly cancer
i hope the treason crimes are televised
he won 1 out of 1 hes been trying to be president since 2000 use the google machine
is it so hard to see that the president is sick
i admit i may have a slight democratic bias
i do n't hate the idea of a wall i hate the idea of how we are getting it
i do n't think it 's a national emergency
why ca n't trump discuss that he 'll put up a wall and enforce ports of entry around the wall
i feel like he does n't sell the wall the way he sells his admiration for fascist leaders chairman chi kim jung un and putin
he could 've made this process go longer to assure his 2020 victory
there is no foresight or strategy here
it almost seems like a kneejerk reaction to pelosi
this hurts to see as a citizen
i believe in a democratic process and want to see trump succeed as he won the election but he seems to not know what he is doing
this kinda broke me when it comes to trump and i 'm an optimist
trump is a beast

president theodore roosevelt built panama canal and used the army corps engineers to complete this difficult project
president trump has the duty to protect our border and perhap uses the budget and personnel of the army
woohoo

also illegal crossings have gone down because of the wall
trump is a danger to national security
did he imply he is looking into death penalties for drug offenses in the united states
bravo trump
zero is what we want
an hour of lies
lying
how can people listen to this
buildthewall
if he farted for 40 minutes on the microphone it would be more bearable than his awful improved comedy act
i ca n't wait until a democratic president uses a national emergency for climate change
the next potus could seize private lands build solar panels shut down coal power plants and take away oil reserves in the arctic
i thought it was impossible to hate him anymore
i was wrong
i have never seen such stupidity we do need a wall trump is right
congress is in charge of appropriating the money
trump 36:44
this is an abuse of power and i hope this all gets tied up in courts until after he gets thrown in jail
usa
usa
usa
unlimited stupidity of
i 'm starting a kickstarter campaign to have his speeches all red by billy west in zapp brannigan voice
that way the presidency will not be all for nothing
this is a straw poll to see how likely am i to succeed
who 's with me
they are illegal aliens period

i was hoping he was n't that dumb but hey you get what you vote for
i quit
wtf
why does he keep lying
he goes against every statistic does n't he watch tv in his executive time
democratic gov
if you are against building a barrier on our border
plan and simple you are an idiot
i agree with putting up a wall and stopping all the illegal immigrants coming in but why so much money
doing what you have to do dealing with this unreasonable bunch in congress
border security is national security
the thing is 80 of illegal immigrants come by plane and just stay on over stayed visas
that has been revealed as drug dealers
since he is so concerned about drugs coming into this country
that 's what us sane americans want trump tha g.o.a.t
i watched this man on tv this morning
where did we go wrong
trump blows a bone spur
wall is getting built
deal with it
maga2020
breaking news
obama ’ s wife “ big mike ” michelle has been medically diagnosed with an enlarged prostate
our prayers are with “ big mike ” as he/she undergoes treatment
learn the law
there is a reason the president has veto power to keep congress in check
yeah cnn ask my wife she was pressured into marriage with her first husband that was illegal and he beat the crap out of her and we live in florida
build the wall
fake news
the constitution gives the house control of spending
this is an unconstitutional usurping of power and should be opposed by all patriotic americans
his despotic attempt act is a form of treason because it breaks his oath of office to uphold the constitution
impeach now not later
if you dont like it move to mexico see how that works out for you
damn my brain hurts with this stupidity
democrats would use a state of emergency to gather guns if they wanted to regardless of what republicans do or what trump does
also the supreme court would decide if it was an emergency or not
threats by the left
1/1
congress failed to do their jobs
70.000 people dead from drugs that came through the border
it is a national emergency
with nafta gone then mexico is essentially paying
the wall needs built
cbs news needs to also report other truths instead of continuing with the hate trump media
such there was no collusion with russia by the president
potus 2020


democratic party ’ s complicity is a national emergency
this country needs to get its priorities interests in check this years america sucks
death penalty for “ drug sales ”
can ’ t wait to see all those cannabis users get killed in prison for using it
can ’ t wait to see police who we have proven plant drugs on civilians and get them the death penalty
all this money and the deficit and the national debt still goes up things that make you hmmmmm
stand vertically
hes not sane
he has to be removed from office
cbs replace all your staff with spanish speaking border crossers of recent
get out white privledge
president honey badger
🦡
for these angel moms nobody is asking how the illegal immigrant actually got into the country
1:18:10 trump is an embarrasment dude cant back up his made up numbers
i guess to trump this is negotiation
i sign the congress bill to get some money
i am not lying in the sense i did sign the bill
and this is a compromise
then he goes to take money from emergency
this way technically trump is not lying by signing
could use the money for health care protection of the environment and education
republicans do n't get mad when a democrat president does it thats all im saying
so the funding bill for the federal government has been signed into law and 800,00 federal workers will not have their paychecks held hostage again this year
apparently some republican politicians convinced trump that another partial shut-down would be incredibly stupid
watch the trump administration try to get approval from various congressional committees to change how funding has been allocated to various federal departments agencies and programs
watch any committee chaired by a democrat deny the request to divert funding
did he give any data to back up his comment on drugs not primarily coming through the airport port of entry
this is the moment in u.s history to see if democrats can face their challenge to chew gum and walk at the same time
chew in a sense to get the idiot and his accomplices out before the idiot hands the world political balance to the enemies and walk in a sense to lead the nation by our constitution without looking like keystone cops else we have two branches of idiots
thank god for trump
nobody can take place president donald trump in 2020 election
uh


and uh


uh
pity that native americans did n't think about building a wall
can someone verify for me that shinzou abe actually recommended trump for a nobel peace prize
or is he confusing moon jae-in for abe obby
the drugs that are caught crossing the border are caught at crossings
he is trying to protect america and americans
let him and homeland security do their job
if you hate him so much leave
what american people are they talking to
because majority of american people i know want a solution at the border
consider not letting any more people into the country even legally with robotics and artificial intelligence taking jobs our children face a smaller job selection
every month we are averaging an influx of 50,000 illegal immigrants between ports of entry
alas del borracho
i do n't did n't have a job with security clearance needed
why the gossip
read the news and find american-born became russian spies and were charged for bombing data taken
american citizens want a stronger us border wall
this is our wall not trump wall
he is one of the most inarticulate idiotic leaders i have ever heard wow
president
nah dictator crybaby trump
if congress had done their jobs and given the money to build this wall this could have been avoided
dnc have taken money from cartels for years and need to answer for their crimes
he did n't lie to congress about going to court
then he goes to the courts to get funding if he ca n't see eye to eye with congress
it 's not bypassing congress he tried twice to give them the oppertunity to give the people what they wanted and they failed twice
trump is a man made disaster
trump hijacks other peoples pain and suffering to legitimize his bogus money schemes and political showboating
imagine the future if we spent 23 billion on education instead of foolish racism
just a plastic gangster with terrible hair

omg obama did declare a national emergency on climate change obama also declared a state of emergency on whats going on in the sudan wtf does that even have to do with the state of the united states
currently there are 31 national emergencies in effect obama did 12 and clinton did 17 nobody said anything about it you guys really are fake news
chooo chooo here 's the clue train
last stop fake news cbs
you guys are the news it 's your job to report facts
you should be ashamed of yourselves
no
no ingles
fewer and fewer
in 2016 census declared that we had 10 of mexico inside our borders illegally
it 's going up

no ingles
mexicans are n't the problem though
this is not a national emergency we do n't need the freaking wall 😠 he needs four walls around him
stats of illegal immigrants “ committing less crime than us citizens ” is skewed by 1 vetted visa overstayers a low crime group 2 unreported crimes in communities with people in us illegally 3 often legal status of people incarcerated goes unreported 4 deportations
if illegal invaders is at a 12 year low what about the caravans
is that fake news
democrats are crisis deniers but not climate change deniers
pick and choose your reality
people are obsessed with money thinking that it will bring one further and higher in life
considering the physical life on earth maybe granted
but we all know that nothing physical goes accross to after death
ascwell no one has ever come back to say that the knowledge gathered in this world does not serve in the after death
in a matter of taking a chance i would rather gather knowledge and wisdom just in case
90 of all illegal drugs and other contraband come thru legal ports of entry
a wall alone will fail
he had 25 billion a year ago
but kelly coulter limbaugh and hannity all said no
after trump agreed less than 24hrs later he flips
that is on the public record
then coulter and limbaugh spoke and he flipped again
also on public record
access to all types of guns will change
republicans be careful what you wish for
you open the door be prepared for the results
poor fatus i got about 8 minutes in and he looked so lost and confused
worst president of modern times and he keeps sinking
so sad and so many republican snowflakes that followed him
like rats in a sinking ship are republicans in 2019 who would have thought
❤🇺🇸president donald trump forever 🇺🇸❤
yes
build the wall finally
keep crying haters
boo hoo
can ’ t wait for the next order of emergency regarding climate change and gun control
i hope the next president be radicals and stupid like this one and take your guns away
the people that dont support trump just dont want to support his wall hence its bias
they think its to blame a woman..they think its to blame russia
they think its to blame a certain document welp thats the democrats for you guys they had time to explain im very very very tired of not getting my answers also being attacked by democrats

no mames

trump lost his fight for funding
this is not an emergency
this is going to be the path the democratic party can now use to end gun sales declare green law fix healthcare
this non emergency will fall on mcconnell
mcconnell has just ended the control the senate has over a president forever
this strikes me as radical not conservative
this ends bad
cbs how disrespectful of you to cut out on his speech at 22 minutes
what is wrong with you cutting him off
he 's our elected president
disgraceful behavior on your part
good lord having to listen to these idiots before and after potus painful
god bless our potus

i am watching this and i ca n't understand how anyone could not agree with trump 's common sense
guess what
that would deter drug dealing here the same as this policy did in the philippines and china
common sense does not register with those who live in delusion denial and deceit that is a fact
leftism is a mental illness
yes we are currently at war overseas but we are so detached from it over here
we need to spend all that money on this country
8 to 25 billion is nothing in the long run and we will have a wall that will last a lifetime
build the wall

tienes temor
the national emergency is the russian mole planted in the white house named donald trump
trump steals from the poor to give to the rich
i saw betos rally where he said that in the last 10 years 4000 women men and children die in an attempt to cross the border illegally
a wall would probably stop the majority of these attempts less dead people
who cares about drugs etc
it can potentially save lifes
what 's the debate about then
go trump

i 'm portuguese and i live in portugal and i too would not want to be invaded by hoards of 3rd world sub-human animals to wreck havoc in my country built with hard work blood and tears
there are channels for people to apply for immigration and there is the law
go trump
protect your people
what is next
no elections in 2020
trumpsters you are blind like religious fanatics which some of you are anyway if you accept the rape of our constitution and embrace this uncivilized con-man with your sickly blind loyalty and your my-way-or-the-highway non-democratic thinking
the base truly are deplorables
hillary was totally spot-on
why does trump keep saying the the trade agreements will bring in a ton of money to the treasury
trade benefits do not go into the treasury unless you tax them
cbsn propaganda news network sucks
rolls eye at this cheeto wow he is a sad man..how can you tell when trump is lying
his mouth is moving..that is the new joke hitting on line anymore..so sad..so much double talk and repeating himself..he is trying so hard to convince who about his lying
support donald trump

thumbs up 👍👍👍 if you want to see trump and his administration go down like joffery from gameofthrones
this guy is so stupid
how does he still have supporters
crying dems are anti americans do away wiyh them
however the same legislative branch working with the doj allowed or i should say gave a directive to the batf to ban bump stocks and any rate increasing device for firearms
what about illegal search and seizure and the constitutional right protecting u.s citizens that are gone
they do n't want these devices they want the guns
bump firing an ar type rifle does n't need a device
no the diane feinsteins of the world want to ban our guns
the political swamp in d.c does n't have a drain hole
go president trump
show the demorats what time it is
i will vote for you again mr president
elchumpo had your money so take it
parkland was staged
fact
100
we need to remove this obviously mentally ill traitor in the oval office
and we need to get rid of mitch the con as well

cbs fake news network
17000 americans died from fentanyl last year 109 people a day die from opioid related death people are trying to rush our border by the thousands in my mind those are national emergencies
all loopholes need to be closed getting rid of incentives for illegal migration
taken advantage of america
fact checks please
but if you want to do something about drugs and overdose then spend that money on helping the people who are buying stealing dying and killing for it
a wall ca n't stop that
spanky has to borrow from paul to pay off peter
now he has to declare a national emergency to pay off peter
spanky is a joke spanky trying to get the money out of the white house couch cushions
spanky jonesing and spanky think he chilling like a villain but he just waiting to go to jail
the big house has a lot of medieval walls they want you to take a look at
goodbye america
please see human trafficking for the horrific disgrace that it is
such a whiney child
the wall is a waste of time and money people can just dig under it
this is the out for him
he can ’ t risk another shutdown and continue to tank his approval rating
declaring this as a ‘ national emergency ’ is a gesture for his base and personalities like coulter that “ hayy i ’ m doing something ”
this act will then be bogged down in the courts while any actual progress on building the wall is futile given how the federal government are absolutely hopeless at building things on time and under budget
if someone wants to see the consequences of open borders travel to europe and see their pathetic situation now
well done mr president this is what i voted you for
well the us has had a lot of pretty terrible presidents but this one takes the prize
he 's a total joke to the rest of the world
bout damn time
this combined with the senate intel committee announcement liberals are scrambling
the majority of people want to come here work send money home build there house and small store and go back home
the wall will never stop people from coming here but will stop people from going back
trump is a racist and a bafoon
target specific group illegal immigrant hitler jew then use selection become leader
what a stupid question one of the reporters asked i 'm paraphrasing he asked that most of the drugs come through the ports of entry where do you get your statistics from
if the reporter would stop to think then he would know that statistics are derived from known facts ports of entry included
how about all the drugs that come through unguarded borders
trump for president 2020
how many felony are committed by illegal
please show the statistics
they 're not all gangs and smugglers
we ca n't have trump in 2020
i look forward to our incoming democratic president declaring a state of emergency on climate change and gun violence
of course before he was president everything was really tremendously bad and he has been trying and achieving the correction for the usa
liar liar
brimstone and fire ”
i have watched fake news networks for years
i can no longer trust them
not one second has been dedicated to telling us the russian collusion story was false
it has consumed all networks for two years
i would n't believed it that there really was fake news but they have proved it over and over
it is evident they hate trump but you 'll see in 2020 america loves president trump
he loves america and so do i
thank god for the wall
the only fabrication is the 24 hour news cycle of cnn and all the rest of them
god bless america and god bless trump
wake up and smell the reality
tv channels already has their place on tv do not suppory tv channels on youtube 👍🏼 youtube is for the people 👍🏼 support youtubers not chanels
this makes me sick that the president has to fight to defend our border
what this liar fails to tell americans is that we the american people are paying his tariffs
i ordered an e-bike i have been saving for
i priced it last summer
in the fall i went to the dealer and the price had gone up over 200.00
why i asked
dealer said they used to make them here in the u.s now they moved manufacturing to china and i had to pay the tariff fees to have it shipped here
trump is the ultimate liar

we lost 25 american lives to illegal immigrants per day in 2007 when the illegal population was at it 's peak
if that is n't a emergency what is
there 's places along the boarder where they ca n't build the wall so why bother building any
so do something about cops using and dealing felony control substances while randomly arresting and accusing innocent people wasting their time savings and reputations who end up being acquitted
compared to when
get the man a brain scan and some medical treatment
is he saying we should give the death penalty to drug dealers
a non violent crime
if only stupidity lying treason and a bad tan were cause for the death penalty
mr president we stand behind you sir
all you liberal idiots that want to basically run this country in the ground need to go jump the fence right over to mexico and stay there
we do n't need no liberal idiotic heathenistic yellow bellied turtles here in the usa
he can not be bought and thats why you dont like him
😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
th
google maps satellite view of mexican towns bordering u.s.a have bars on every window door and even balconies
lots of walls too
gang graffiti at just about every corner
why
but seriously what is so wrong with dea seized pot sold to regulated wholesalers in pot legal states
and that money used to build a wall and fund other dea activities
with you all the way mr president
i realy dont understand the stupidness of this reporter
there is no crises cause drugs trafficking figures are coming down

😁😁😁 keeping promises trump 2020
there was already a wall
it emerged from the human heart
he is doing what we the people need and want
ooh excuse me excuse me belive me belive me mexicos going to pay for the wall
a humanitarian crisis
the only humans that person worries about are the upper 1
people on disabilities are drowning
low income families are starving
impeach
his racism is blatantly obvious
i am not a rich jew
i pray that congress does what is needed
stop letting this man lie to america
arrest him and hannity
they the republican 's will regret this day
no more need for congress
might as well tare up the constitution of the united states
since republican 's have failed to do there job 's of oversight and have let trump stomp all over the constitution and our laws
he could n't get it by law even when they controlled the entire congress
and now they are actually going to allow him to circumvent congress
25billion he walked away
1.6 billion he shuts down government
1.375 billion he signs and declares national emergency
w t f
so much money wasted on ice so much for the wall so much money and all unnecessary for there is a very easy solution to put a stop to all illegal immigrants which would pay for its self for enforcement simple pass felony crime law for any one doing any business with illegals with heavy fines
no jobs no sales no rentals no free food no hand outs
they would all leave here overnight we wouldent even need a wall
this is terrifying
the rambling of an infantile egotist a man who is clearly uninformed and ignorant who catches bits and pieces of information and filters out anything he does n't like while latching on to ideas he does like regardless if they are backed up by facts
a confused ball of anger and resentment a man with such a limited vocabulary that if you strip out the odd buzz words and constantly repeated phrases he would be indistinguishable from a twelve year old child except for the hatred and vulgarity
archie bunker meets peter griffin meets scrooge mcduck meets a black hole of stupidity
god help our country
it totally mystifies me how these media people are so irrational
trump may not be likable but this blind and irrational hate is tearing we the people apart
a whirl pool of ignorance below
be warned
god bless president trump no politician ever has ever fought against washington for the american people like him
probably one of his biggest lies this time is when he claimed that illegal aliens make up the biggest part of the people who are in our prisons well guess what trumptards
almost 81 percent of the people in our prisons are american citizens
trump had no choice
if anyone is to blame it 's the swamp rats who would n't lift a finger to help american lives from killer illegals
i say go for it trump
it 's about time this border address needs to finally be brought up to a national emergency level
trump says ‘ i didn ’ t need to do this ’ while declaring national emergency
what a fool
100 chance of liberal tears today🙌🏼👏🏼👏🏼🇺🇲
build the wall
we can not have this country be unsafe
maga
i approve
there is an iq gap between regular people and journalists
trump talked about a wall while campaigning his base grasped the concept of a physical barrier
he described a wall like israel uses
did he 'promise to build that same wall
not that i ever heard
is mexico going to pay for the wall
yes they are
that is going to save us 54 billion dollars per year
that sounds like mexico is going to be paying for the wall to me
someone tell me what ’ s going on
i don ’ t wan na watch this
while trump waste wall money and pocket his wallet from it the next democrat president is going to order a destruction of the trump wall
to sum it up we as americans have just wasted time and money
maga
america will get worse once the wall is up
1 what happened to his campaign promise
mexico will pay for the wall
has that been forgotten
2 he can not get away with making the new congress the bad guys
potus had control of both houses for 2 years why did n't he push getting funds for the wall then
what wrong with this picture
if i am dilusional someone please enlighten me
brake the law
this clown has has put a brake to the law by destroying the rule of law i believe you are a russion robot ivan
put up your photo
idiot
way to go trump
a impotent congress needs a president that shows some leadership
the democrats ca n't stand it
btw what a bunch of horse crap to tie the presidents hands in the present agreement requiring border mayors to ok the border wall
well just kiss my arse
more stupid bullcrap the dems just do n't get it

he was a member of a presbyterian church
what are they teaching him there
double toasted brought me here
revelation 22 5 there will be no more night
and they will reign for ever and ever
9/11/2001 was painful too
why was he waving around a hand with a finger blown off
ouch
hi rabbi your cousin rochel leah is my teacher
i mean come on as young christians or catholics or baptist or whatever your faith maybe we all ask that question
sad indictment on the current situation that 60 people disliked this
the shooter is a coward and if i could you do n't want to know
revalation 3:9,2:9 is a warning against your beastly nation
may god almighty heal the rabbi and the members of the synagog ❤️✌️
both the rabbi and the mayor are wonderful people thank you to everyone that supports the community in this terrible time
so sorry for your loss rip dear lori may god send a quick recovery to all the wounded
i was touched

thank god for the armed border patrol guard
it could have been worse
evil or insanity call it whatever you want exists and it will always exist
despite utopian fantasies
my god
this hate crime is too much
my heart goes to you all
an off-duty policeman stopped the bad guy with a gun never ban guns
this world is close to the end i cant stand it here i cant even watch the nightly news anymore to see how sick and twisted people are
the audio off

wicked evil nation of beast and you 're not a creation of tmh in his image or anything else but something set upon the children of israel because of our forefathers disobedience thus we were punished now you got next
why am i here what am i supposed to do and what 's the mission
we passover worshipers must not give in to hate today is not a day to indulge in selfishness
boy i feel sorry for your lost but palestinians go through this anguish every day at the hands of your ppl
sometimes i wonder if all of us were the same color have the religion would we be getting along
this is a truly fishy and fake sounding report
this must be a false flag
media is part of the problem
he is a monster give him the needle

did he just say slavery
what slavery
revelation 3:9 2:9
this is only the beginning of sorrows
am yisrael chai

i know that people of faith from everywhere will come together re-birth and re-dedication will happen
may all in poway be blessed by g*d thank you for your wisdom and greatness of heart
this is an awful tragedy
like the church shooting in south carolina where a body of christian worshipers were gunned down
that shooter was invited to worship with them
afterwards the shooter conducted target practice on them
what denomination is next
jehovah witnesses and other denominations are locking their doors
we are a jewish nation he screamed
america is not a jewish nation
maybe he was thinking of israel
out of this man 's pain is the revealing of this church leader 's politic
jesus christ would not have carried on this way
jesus christ did not cry terrorist or shout angrily
he consoled others in his last hours
this man screamed out jews organizing
fill the synagogues
was that jesus christ 's method
he left brooklyn because it was too dangerous yet the violent crime strucked him in a place he persumed safe
where is christ 's spirit
god says to not call anyone rabbi
i am the only father
matthew 24
so soon after the winnipeg café incident too
i wonder what other similarities these incidents have
is the shooter also white
they do n't understand why this happened
the jews are thieves liar 's and greedy with money
that 's all they care about
you brought this on yourselves
we are fighting back
6:00 the gun jammed that may have saved dozens of lives
learned behavior parents are thw blame
let us pray for those that claim to be gods chosen people
we know from gods word the holy bible that the african americans are the ones spoken of in scripture
amen and amen
so very sad
hate causes hate
it ’ s sad to have to innocent people this kind of evil act
my people have never committed an act of terrorism
i am so sorry this happened to them
i ca n't even be hopeful that it will not happen again
i am in pain for the victims and in fear for the future horrors to come here in the u.s
love will overcome hate
what ’ s wrong with this world 😢🥺🙏🙏
very sad but they cover this for hours and days
yet the racially motivated hate crime done to landon hoffmann at the mall of america gets seconds of air time
its a joke
he has strength courage and optimism
the attacker has only darkness
if anyone thinks this is horrific then one has not seen all the dead children shot in the head by idf snipers
my condolences to the shooter and his family
no sympathy for israel and its supporters
every generation is victimized
is he palestinian
i ’ m so sorry
to the people who are claiming that this is fake it is not
to anyone who believes that this is fake you need to experience the site of a tragic event like this and stop questioning what the survivors say
this also applies to all other past mass shootings
i feel very angry that this tragedy has happened 6 months after the tragedy that happened at the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh pennsylvania
the levels of anti-semitism in this country is just sickening
if judaism was n't created then the world would n't have christianity or islam
such hatred is irrational
he does this all with blown off fingers
you can see what hate did to him
i send healing energy
it 's pretty fncked up that this man who 's been through something terrible has to be consoled by the there were good people on the jews will not replace us
sides
maybe he could whip his idiot base into more of a fervor and we can go ahead with this thing
only cowards bomb people who ca n't defend themselves
terrorism cowardice
god be with all of you my heart hurts
the jew cries out in pain as he stabs you
californian born and raised here you have my heart and soul in this land
suffer not the little children to come unto me thus sayith tmh elohim lord of all host
now who are those who you suffered the truth from
nobody take terrorism seriously when they attack ours
very sad
if you worship you will be attacked if you do n't worship you wo n't be attacked

jewish folks are some of the kindest sweetest humble caring folks ever known
i was crying hearing the description of the events that took place
god bless you all
another senseless act of domestic terrorism
but mexicans are the criminals lets build a wall
it 's no coincidence as to why we 've seen a rise in violent attacks from white supremacist groups since trump announced he was running for president
trump has been the motivating factor of it all
trump has been inciting and encouraging violence and hatred amongst his cult followers since his campaign
23 february 2016
i 'd like to punch him in the face
trump said this in front of a crowd of his cultists after a protester was removed from one of his rallies
22 november 2015
maybe he should have been roughed up
trump said this in reference mercutio southall jr who was ejected from a trump rally
the video footage showed trump supporters jostling kicking and punching southall
it even prompted the fox friends hosts to question the violence from trump 's cultists
march 2016
trump said this during a rally in st louis as protesters were being escorted out by security
trump became frustrated that it was taking so long to escort the protesters out
february 2016
knock the krap out of him
would you
trump said this at a rally in cedar rapids iowa
33 years ago you were 24
33 24 57 but you look 75
god bless our president donald trump
a decade of aggression
the
order
👺
john t earnest 's mother 's maiden name is lisa christine newberg
she 's jewish
what i 've just stated can be factually verified
why is n't that tidbit being reported
the only way to demolish the terrorists is to get the terrorist-in-chief trump out of the white house
it 's time for the dignity of life back

i am so sorry you all have to go thru such an event
respect all religions even if you do not believe in what they believe in
i am not religious
my god is the stars and science
it does not make us evil
evil is what just happened against these humans
i can smell his breath from here
have the democrats sent their deepest condolences or sympathies to these passover worshipers

did you catch this pos who did this
the story just does n't add up
too fake
the face of fraud
but the truth remains we are in the end of days
the jews must return to israel
these incidents will only increase
do not fight the will of our maker
next phase is rpgs..do not dare say you were not warned
make haste exodus style
prayers for lamb 's blood covered door worshippers
terrorists are cowers
stand tall
😢
time to move on with this bs

it 's terrible what happened there 's no reason for that just wickedness but i pray for comfort for the family in the name of jesus amen
sorry but this rabbi so just so fake
that shooter is a coward
he came in with a bulletproof vest called the police so they dont shoot him and put his hands up to show he surrenders
they should have finished him
horrible acting make it stop

o god i ’ m very very sad 😢 last day is coming soon lord jesus coming soon i pray israel people 🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🙏🙏🙏💔💔
and this is why i say neo-nazis are a bigger problem than white supremacists
for the next decade anyway
goyim ’ s souls come from the 3 satanic spheres
jew ’ s souls are from god
moshiach will dust them
lets send in the bearjew and the inglorious basderds
so
those words should be getting screamed in trump 's ears 24x7
matthew 23:39 for i tell you you will not see me again until you say 'blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord
baruch haba b ’ shem adonai..call on the prince of peace as he is the only one that can bring it
it 's time that all of these white supremacists hate groups be classified as terrorists organizations because that 's exactly what they are
websites like storm front should all be banned and removed from the internet wherever they pop up
this is disgraceful how 's he going to count all his cash now so is he going home now this has happened
oh sorry my mistake jews do n't have a home 🙄
it would seem prudent to me to question the evil terrorist as regards his motive in this deed
i suspect the usual media news approach will close down that possibility and we will hear almost nothing of the shooter 's evil motivation
merely repeating endlessly that he is surely evil is all we need to keep us warm at night
it will be kept curiously quiet
this is sometimes known as the george bush solution we fill in the relevant designated victim s in any news story and emphasize their significance as a politically correct minority whenever possible are all innocent they hate us for our freedoms it is never us who hate and oppress them
white supremacist do n't get to go to heaven
they hate their brothers for no reason
they believed in a lie called race
the truth is we actually are all related
they 'll have to find out the hard way
concept.pope john paul second forgave his would be assassin america is watching it is not enough for a jew to forgive another jew on yom kippur but to forgive a non jew for his dastardy crime
yes we are and praise god and jesus 🙏😇🙌
pakistan and turkish army should establish a permanent military base in jerusalem in order to protect the al aqsa masjid in palestine
blame ilhan omar shame

throw some anit semitism bills on the printing press
the goyim will never know
i shared this out
may the reverend rabbi now after his miraculous escape dedicate his life to expose the terrorism of the colonial state of israel and the jewish lobby that supports it in the us
the possibility of a shooter with an ar15 shooting both hands is 1 and 100000000000000000000000000 but it happen yesterday
fire do melt steel i guess
another staged attack in attempt to take my guns
molonlabe
god bless president trump
greenpath
i hate cliff hangers on youtube
meddle maddox and the cherokee
trump is anti-christ
the time of the gentiles are soooo over cant you see the truth
instead they rather wine about prophecy
very painful
why the dislikes
unfathomable
shut up rabbi
check this man 's narrative the time sequence his exposure in the media to his meeting of another liar donald trump at the white house in d.c
sad
but same thing happen every house of palestine
weird still talking about 1 jew killed when same timeframe a guy killed 7 and injured 1 oh they were n't jews so noone cares not to mention that this story screams fake
davon anderson youtib
so i guess a bunch of morons are going to blame trump for this one too the world is an evil place there 's no getting around it
meanwhile trump refuses to denounce white supremacy/groups
nor will he authorize the doj to set up a task force to go after them specifically
basically saying 'thats a waste of resources
blame islam and bad things will happen
respect islam
and they will be marrying and having feast and festivals when the terrible day of tmh comes upon them like a thief in the night
you are not the chosen ones if so where is your savior
b and w looks like the guy from all in the family what was his name meathead
it 's hard to hear the heartbreaking
cbs is fake news
bless the athiest
your people do the same and even worse things to the palestinians
god bless the children of israel in jesus name
amen
he only makes america worse
it was n't made up like sandy hook adam lanza
lies
fake arm sling
fake hebrew
fake shooting
ask him if she cared about all the palestinian children the idf murdered this year
this is indeed tragic but all these christians making sad faces do n't give a damn about the average palestinian that has no control over what their leaders do
all they know is israel said they deserved it
and died in his arms bc no ambulances were allowed to into the area
why is n't this on every network
the answer corporate news and the nra
yesterday it was said 1 dead 3 injured
this is just one story
think for a minute about the vegas shooting or the other synagogue from a year ago
the parkland students have not stopped
each death a life
a day after neo-nazis and white supremacists are defended once again
so we see that march on all the media shouting the jews will not replace us
then there 's this
go figure
when a white person does this its a hate crime
a person of color domestic terrorism
i lay this squarely at the feet of you know who
he 's just depressed
secondly he loves trump and trump loves the heebz
so just keep taking the goyem shekels
that 's all that matter
oy vey

they simply don ’ t have the funds
yesterday i had a tourism geography exam and i wrote about notre dame
😐
someone said at the end of the day its just a building
the gods of gaul are taking back their city
the evil of the church will no longer be suffered without fighting back

diversity is not unity

i hope it can be restored for future generations to witness and learn about
sad news indeed
u can here a lime scooter ringing in the background
this seems intentional being that there is a religious holiday coming up and that the cathedral is a symbol of western values and culture
hmmm
this is sad
alexa play despacito
i am just curious how did it start
obviously the fire was not a mistake
heartbreaking
no-truh dahm
perhaps money have been trashed away to keep up armaments and bombing the last freely standing street corner in syria and fire protection of national treasure monuments got a eurochange sad very sad heritage monument gone in flames

not taken long before the hands extended for cash donations
the catholic church has billions in the bank not heard anything from them yet 👎

now there ’ s notre dame they can do about it now
but no families have been seperated as a result no children will face short and long term mental health issues through loss
the levels of swift aid via donation and other suggestions are reasons i 'm ashamed to be a part of this race the human one

my god this is a terrible loss
what if all the historical landmarks in the world just start burning
wow it is really horrible that such an amazing old building could have been destroyed 😐
provoking games by elite politician who start the fire an priesthood smoke weeds vodoo rituals burn candles vodooo rituals
illuminati you want to burn a church wait until we take your shrine and child 👶 sacrificing alter and you cbs eye 👁
watch its coming to a end we know you did this
me sad😞
this ca n't be replaced by the fire
i visited this on assasins creed unity
i bet this was the last gasp globalist false flag attack
hoping parisian christians and louisianan christians can heal this year knowing its soul breaking to see a houses of faith and worship burned though for different reasons
the world is gon na end soon
after 840 years and surviving two world wars destroyed due to government and church mismanagement
i just want to reeeeeeeee
how sad this is
just was talking about my visit there yesterday
i was shocked to hear of this horrific fire today
2:58 mmmkay
maybe someone stole all the goods inside then lit the fire 🔥
this is what happens when you build with wood every time
donations can be directed to

christendom remains unscathed
pff i do n't care
if this turns out to be the work of islamic terrorist expect mecca to be hit
they should ’ ve turned off fire spread
they should ’ ve turned off fire spread
family was going to paris and was going to see this just a little tooooooo late
i hope france gets better and i'ma sorry that happened i 'll pray 🙏 for you france
i was just singing “ out there ” this afternoon because i was practicing for an audition and then the cathedral burns down
crazy
molten metal molten metal molten metal

this is so sad 😞
it could be a torch or a candle that cause the fire
who is this man they brought in
what a goof
烧得好
ok who did it
rodan or burning godzilla

so sad although ironically reflective of the demise of france
the cross
mecca is next
watch
this is anger
a shame
people will rise up badly after this
humiliation

it is so sad to heard notre dam was destroyed a little bit by fire
i was watching breaking news yeasterday.😭
that message was to the global elite who are watching your every move
v is that you
where the f did they get this guy
i am deeply saddened to see this happen
this guy has no idea what happens to stone when heat is applied
the cathedral is a total wreck
some pieces maybe saved
this is not my wish but the truth
vivi the french vivi notre dame
g r e a t now im crying at 2 am
have you heard the name of dr zakir naik
there has been ten churches burnt down in france in the last month now notre dame a female isis member was jailed two weeks ago for having a car bomb to blow up this church
damn
yes thank u jesus christ for taking down babylon from within👏🏆
never heard of it
now i do
disfigured
i wished i could ’ ve visited this historical monument before this horrific catastrophe incident
taking 2 centuries to build destroying in about 63min
🇫🇷 is totally disfigured
10 a muslim set this fire
the ending is coming give it some yrs
praying for whoever is effected by this terrible accident
hopefully it 's just the timber roof that got destroyed
p.s
see that yellow-green smoke
i think that 's vaporized lead
the french people need jesus and to become biblical christians
i hope quasimodo made it out
i always wanted to visit this site and was planning to do so next summer and damn
ugh don ’ t say notre dame like that🤧
crime satanique les masques vont tomber dieu va le faire savoir merci pour votre compation vive la france libre et démocratique et souveraine
i do n't mean to be disrespectful or out of line here but paris has a population of 2 million people and only 1 fire hose
the entire city can not save one building burning
is this another distraction
this is so sad
it ’ s even worse because my friend loves europe and her and her family were going to the notre dame next week😢☹️


what ’ s happening to paris

im gon na blame the terrorist
1:44 waiting for the monster to attack
they can rebuild it
imagine if this happened to the eiffel tower
we know by now the cause of the fire welding sparks from a torch caused it
notre dame has not burned since the revolution and we know how bad that was read hunchback it will tell you what happened during that fire
i wonder if they called it fixing news instead of breaking news if that would help

we should have told quasimodo to quit smoking blunts inside the church
does no one at your network know how to pronounce notre dame
all the people making jokes are evil and cruel
like wtf would u do this
only a man made building
someone did n't want to stay in the bell tower anymore
quasi looking at you
hellfire desire xd
nb4 they turn it into a mosque
this place was santanic
did the scaffolding boards get burnt
we all know that everyone is sad
i am so sorry that this had to happen 😢 😢😢😢
the jews they did this
hey we need a makeover
give us money
my guess is an electrical fire started in the renovation area from faulty wiring or something
do n't want to jump on the conspiracy wagon just yet
its just a building it 'll get rebuilt
not once was god ever mentioned
these are places of worship unto god the father god the son god the holy spirit for the masses of christian 's for centuries
and you could n't even give that respect
and you cbs wonder why people have walked away from your slanted news
you have lost all credibility and should never be trusted again
where did the fire come from
absolutely no effort to pronounce it correctly
well done
ici c'est la france

so sad
so sad
mon dieu another world treasure gone
j suis paris💕💖
so sad
welp
frollo 's back at it again
very sad
however i do n't think they should rebuild it.they should leave what remains and redo the middle portion as a place for people to commune
a place that represents the past present and future
i see on the news that it has been saved from total destruction
meh just build condos in its place
1:48 i think it was a lime scooter all along
gods wrath on the catholic church
you bet this is
nothing bad can happen unless god allows it
repent
take down your idols and statues of devils
it is a very sad event in the history of man
neat
they are playing off of your emotions
your subject of mind control
i feel very sorry for what happened in france
it gives me much more grief that this money is not used to help people
to make donations for people who can do micro-enterprises and do not have the capital to do so
i work but i have not had the luck to be born with money
but i can generate jobs

so who is doing it
may allah save and bless paris
goog job
sadly it will be interesting to see who establishes the price of this
and who owns the insurance and therefore who pays etc

did the hunchback survived
the phrase “ god works in mysterious ways ” runs a bit thin here

any ideas as to what caused it
this looks like no accident someone or some group did this
welp somebodys getting fired
i hope they can restore the cathedral
dark forces
where was macron when it went up
he 'd do anything to try and deflect from the issues in france
uhhh umm erm oof
dats the house of satan if dat was gods dat would never ever catch a fire
omg
did quasimodo make it out
😱
let it be rebuilt in a contempary style and safer
god bless the people of france🙏
9/11 second edition
of course they have to talk about the history.let the ignorant learn.this is not just the twin towers in nyc
so who did it
those who try to hide the fruits will be found out those who hide wicked and evil things you will be cast down for all the souls that you have took with you
nash thumbs up
es lamentable ver la perdida de un gran edificio con historia
how did the fire start
duh
we want to know
i hope this was not arson
quisimodo snapped
i hope it is rebuilt
it probably resulted from something to do with renovations
it ’ s tragic either way
in a time when we are trying so hard to move beyond our past we need those precious few remaining connections to remind us of our history
christianity is being wiped out
i wonder who 's up to no good
the massive fire burns throughout notre dame in paris is nearly similar to the disney film
this guy was boring the people so they decided to talk over him in the background
the hunchback did it
moçambique teve uma tragédia e não recebeu esse ibope todo
on.y 250 views
that professor looks like dana carvey
was it arson
i am sorry for the people who are going through this
god bless those who have been effected by this tragedy
and remember that everything happens for a reason
no matter how negative it may seem
something not right about this
yeah cuz god loves you smh
isis be like lets take blame for that
😭😭😭
u fix it and it ’ ll burn down again
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
if they just would have raked the leaves
how does a building of stone get destroyed like this
bwahahahahahahahahaha hahahaha🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤗
for those who don ’ t know a french millionaire offered to donate 100 million euros to repair the cathedral
800 years of paganism burnt to the ground praise god
i wonder how the hunchback would feel about this
yes
crusaders can all gather together and get thrown into the fire too
this is not where saints are made
ἅγιος hágios hag'-ee-os from ἅγος hágos an awful thing compare g53 g2282 sacred physically pure morally blameless or religious ceremonially consecrated — most holy one thing saint

with all that in every place call upon the name of jesus christ our lord both theirs and ours
3grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ
satan is coming

800 years old damn sad
i picked the wrong time to become an atheist

卧槽？
macron did it
attention seeker
this building survived wars pre fire departments and 8 hundred years why a fire now
we all know this is islamic terror
this is sad
a lot of evil that structure has been apart of that fire is was intentional to the catholic illuminati who agrees
i just saw this video 1 hour after it released and i ’ m like omg i have to see this

en lisant les commentaires on s'aperçoit très vite que les autres pays ne comprennent pas le symbole que cette cathédrale représente pour nous

probably some black metal band who burnt it down
😥
this historical monuments burnt because of à stupide worker that accidentaly put on fire thé wooden roof i swear if he trown à cigarret h will ded
that ’ s tuff
yet the catholic church worships mary which is placing mary before god
burn down the mission
burn down the mission
burn it down to stay alive
it 's our only chance of living
elton john 'burn down the mission
evil religion
god is coming for you all
it 's time to wake up

they planned that thing to be burn down four days ago they took out all these bronze statues and a lot of the other artifacts then all of a sudden it just burns down give me a break that was a planned thing
dang
who let this guy in a news studio
must be islam behind this
let the fooking building burn
worshiping buildings is a sin
😥😢😔
of course i guess they 're going to say it 's an act of god
disney predicted the future
alaverga
it was very likely a building failure it was under renovation and then started burning so it can har been caused by noumerss reasons but we are not sure stop blaming people with out knowing if someone acutally did it
we know
dead
nothing is forever
life goes on
don ’ t get attached and you won ’ t suffer the pain of loss
varg vikernes approved this
what about our nuri masjid that was destroyed my america

nobody cares if houses or hospitals get burned to the ground
but if it ’ s a church omg
ਫਾਜਿਲਕਾ
it ’ s just a building get over it
any word how fire started
foul play
terror attack
some stupid tourist
what what
the god of abraham has grown weary of this idolatry
he is a jealous god
😲😥
vive la revolution

they say they are going to need a lot donations in order to rebuild
what i do n't understand is why did n't they have fire insurance
especially since they had over 700 years to get the insurance
another museum goes up in flames because it stopped being a church long time ago just like all the other cathedrals in europe have because tourists attractions the traditional church is dead jesus christ lives and does not abide in those dead cathedrals
this is so terrible to happen to such a historic icon
nothing to do with islam
какие придурки допустили это
поубивал бы
how the fire broke out
allah save everyone
oof
muslims did this
mark my words
im gon na make a joke but i genuinely feel bad
spent 200 years to build and burnt down in like 20 sec
it was arson or frances building and safety regulations are garbage
how could you be so careless not to have a fire extinguisher close by when renovating one of the most famous buildings on earth this is a sad day seeing something so historic be destroyed
why are msm not mentioning that earlier this month the historic church of st sulpice in paris was set ablaze by an act of arson as reported by newsweek magazine
newsweek ran a story about catholic churches in france suffering recent acts of desecration and vandalism since the beginning of this year
this is so sad and i will be praying
🙏🏼

well i guess satan joined the chat no offense
just for the record watched cnn tonight just cause it was on at the gym
they were reporting on this horrific fire story and i though well at least they 're actually reporting news for once and not constantly bashing our president
is there a tragedy these people wont stand on
why did she disgrace it with that pronunciation
it ’ s not “ no-ter daim ” it ’ s “ no-tre daam ”
nobody died or was hurt so i do n't care
i can ’ t take all these freakin sickos anymore all the hate and ignorance it ’ s ridiculous already 😒
hindu temples should be demolished and ban should be put on idol worship and snake worship
it is igniting the wrath of god because idol worship is unpardonable sin and snake is considered satan in christianity
875 church fires in france in 2018
cbs fake news no reports

hangthetraitors
how does that happen that would never happen to something like the white house or the vatican
what a terrible loss
accident or terrorist attack
this is so crazy but not as crazy as hearing that a muslim man threw a 5yr old american boy that he took from his parents off the 3rd floor balcony at the mall of america in minnesota
this islamic problem must be addressed
i wonder how long it will take for the french anti-semites to blame the fire on the jews
so what comes after all this pedophile bullcrap is what truthers want to know wow insane up the waterfall land of truth this crap never stops amazing life of knowledge we beat the devil we need to stick together into next infinite awesomeness land this thing never stops we will get a break and truth gut when the gross comes out i promise..j
the muslims set it on fire
nah its just a building
but u guys cry over mere building

cbs has the nerve to wonder why people call them fake news when they make up things that did n't happen in the title of a simple youtube video
only one site was burned the fire did not burn through paris
get the facts right or shut the channel down people are sick and tired of opinionated embellishments on the news
i bet it was an american who hates notre dame football
i wish americans would stop the mispronunciation of this name ask someone if you do n't know.notre dame
i feel sad
another european culture that was ruined
nobody care about french weapons being used in yemen to destroy entire cities and killing children
it 's very sad what has happened to norte dame heart of art culture and heritage but this is karma reminding you of how it feels like having monuments of your heritage destroyed in front of your eyes
until yesterday it was called notre dame
today the world now shall know it as
notre flame
😎
yet again we let muslims burn down another piece of western culture
france you know what you got ta do
show the rest of europa that you reject the jewish game of race replacement
it used to be my favorite😢
r.i.p😦 like if your with me😭
i wonder if anybody has asked the contractor what happen
did you see all that scaffolding was ridiculous looking was it necessary to put some much up
i feel sorry for paris because they were trying to fix it up and it burn down
why this is in news making money out of it
my brother ’ s in paris

this is for all of the french atrocities in haiti

if it 's islamic related france will freak out against the migrant flow
i just want to know how this even happened
i hate that this is true but my first thought was terrorist attack
but they don ’ t say mention anything like that so hopefully i ’ m wrong
someone give this professor an energy drink

burn every church on the planet to the ground
religion has held back humanity for millennia
this was horrible reporting as usual
they do n't answer all 6 basic questions who what where when why and how
nope
just avoid it
instead they put on the most boring history professor to dull our interest and i like history
i had to stop listening
you would think with all the rare objects there they would have at least installed a sprinkler system
something is amiss in paradise
very tragic
this horrible fire is another sign that the apocalypse is near
this happens after france officially recognises palestine and the israeli president says it is a grave mistake

kathedrale notre-dame de paris ist abgebrannt tja das ist eben halt die spät und gerechte strafe von gott und satan für die verlorene kreuzzüge und die sache mit den gegenpapst immer und der abendländische schisma

muslims fanatics tried to burn notre dame two years ago
are they involved
hi
i am looking for a place to stay
my last accommodation is now unavailable due to smoke damage
please contact me ‘ hunchback of notre dame at 33036748586
awaken europe
the catholic church created this bad karma and we all know why
feel symbolic and like an attack of some sort
france is going through crazy times
sad sad sad

one cathedral five mosques
thank god
fake news if you think people do not have a brain wow wake up people war is on
according to trump if the french just raked their cathedrals the fire could have been averted
it 's a cathedral management issue
terrorists
what if they just pray the fire away

that 's definitely not an accident either the muslims or the leftist that 's guaranteed

they will say it 's an accident and people believe and before that there were 10 churches burned by accidents over the last year
your lebanese christian brother
dang it frolo
it is bigger than paris
i see a lot of hatred by muslims especially by turks connected this event
man someone else beat me to it😂😂😂
macron and his rothschild illuminati bossed did this 🤬😡👿‼️
ik they ’ re heated 🤣🤣🤷🏾‍♂️
no one
man those black metal bands are making their rounds
i can ’ t believe the entire government of france can ’ t muster up some firefighting helicopters that lift water from nearby rivers or drop fire retardant powder
clearly no plans for potential emergencies
shame
so they finally managed to summon satan in there
lord help us all
tragic
god seems to be warning france to go back to its catholic roots
terrorism
how did it happen
i hate how they had quasimodo locked away but so happy he got out before this fire
v
just a building
big day for black metal fans
roses are red
i was at school
then there was a fire
at the notre dame cathedral
what goes up must eventually come down
god does n't dwell in temples built by human hands anyway
it is indeed not healthy to come up with conclusions at this stage and having doubts is helpful but i know one thing for sure the official explanation will be as laughable as it will be an utterly dishonest coverup
i smell foul-play
the fire will divert attention for theresa mays debacle on brexit
mob grieving should have been turned off
maybe they 'll put up a jacque in the box in its place
at least one italian criticised gothic architecture as germanic and thus barbaric
all masonry and no wood
gothic architecture was known during the period as opus francigenum french/frankish work 2 the term gothic architecture originated in the 16th century and was originally very negative suggesting barbaric

how can it be sad
“ by the pope
” said the stunned crusader
let it burn
i wonder if this had anything to do with muslims
god is already angry for humans used his house of worship for their greed power and decit amassing money frm the poor for their personal luxurious lifestyle
it was the hunchback i said he should n't be allowed matches
watch out you might get what you 're after
boom babies strange but not a stranger

do n't forget the french slavery to africa and the aggression against asia
the destruction of the treasures of mankind in the yuanmingyuan
this is a retribution for the french
britain the united states france germany japan russia italy and the austro-hungarian empire burned the chinese yuanmingyuan in 1900
do n't forget your shameless acts
religion is burning up in flames
after centuries of oppression the church are getting what is coming to them extinction
it 's just a building
1 corinthians 3
16do you not know that you are god ’ s temple and that god ’ s spirit dwells in you
17if anyone destroys god ’ s temple god will destroy him
for god ’ s temple is holy and you are that temple
so wheres quasi-moto gon na stay now
maybe someone started the fire to get the peoples attention to the church so they can rebuild it
xi jinping 's last visit to france was disgraced
this illiterate fool is narrow-minded evil has no bottom line china 's disasters continue xi jinping has a crisis of trust will it

so called religion of peace up to no good i reckon
the hunchback of notre dame is the only place where the cathedral still lives
who cares anymore folks
just tell the friggan truth you are protected be god the creator
image all the sins that happened n that building
blah blah blah lets see it on fire
if its on fire at least show it

notre dame cover-up begins
the cause of the fire at notre dame cathedral has not been determined and may never be
all of the evidence appears to have been destroyed
but that doesn ’ t stop the fake news international media from declaring immediately that the fire was “ an accident ” and that anyone who disagrees is a conspiracy theorist
this is intended to smear anyone like who suspects possible terrorism
reuters reported
the fire that tore through notre-dame cathedral was probably caused by accident french prosecutors said on tuesday after firefighters doused the last flames in the ruins overnight and the nation grieved for the destruction of one of its symbols
yet nobody knows what caused the fire
so they can not say that it “ was probably caused by an accident ”
no honest investigator is allowed to draw such a biased conclusion before any investigation has begun
cnn business reported

even before the blaze at notre dame was extinguished conspiracy theories and fake news about the fire had ricocheted around the internet
infowars a fringe website which is known for spreading conspiracy theories published a story which suggested the fire had been intentionally set
the claim was based on a single erroneous tweet which was later deleted
the infowars story remains online
paris prosecutor rémy heitz said that while the cause of the fire has not been established it was likely accidental
nothing shows that it 's an intentional act he said in a press conference on tuesday
this claim is absurd since nobody knows how the fire started
therefore the cause could be anything from an accident to a terror attack
but the fake news media do not want anyone even mentioning that it was possibly a terrorist attack in order to protect radical muslims
two fox news anchors neil cavuto and shepard smith both cut off guests who suggested that the fire could have been intentional
this “ accident ” narrative could in fact be the beginning of a cover-up conspiracy by the international media of a deliberate terrorist arson
and until one or another is ruled out we can not say what caused the fire
the media of course are saying correctly that the fire started at the site of construction on the cathedral ’ s roof/attic area but then go on to say that some type of construction-related accident was obviously the cause
nonsense
quite the opposite in fact
a radical construction worker like an anti-christian communist or a muslim sympathizer or a radical french muslim laborer working on the project could have started the fire
but reports say that nobody was at the work site at the time
yes but bombs and incendiary devices can be set off by cell phones and we know that arson has been used as a tool of terrorism in recent years
the international media are going to do everything in their power to call this “ an accident ” in an all-out effort to defend muslims
don ’ t believe it
anything is possible

notre dame has been through trauma after trauma and has always been rebuilt
in the long run this is n't much different than anything else that 's happened to it in the past 800 years
vandalism multiple fires multiple revolutions and riots religious insurrections etc
some people did something again
lord jesus
rip
did quasimodo make it out
sudden urge to listen to hellfire
burn baby burn.🔥🔥🔥
if i said that the cathedral should be demolished permanently then you might call me crazy
just as islam has already done with hundreds of other catholic churches across europe

you can rebuild the fallen spires but islam will convert them into minarets
nooooooooooooooooooooo

france has been disrespectful to tmh remember in the 1500 's when they removed him from their constitution what can lady liberty the goddess of heaven do now
watch what god builds up and what man the man of sin trys to do revelation 13

hey maybe you can cover the yellow vest while your there
it 's been 22 week now and not a peep from msm

anyone that knows french 🙄
act of god
aye

lol holy crap
this thing is still burning

migrant workers were hired and they left a burning blowtorch on site
this fire symbolism for the rise of the anti christ

just wait until the leadership at cbs wake up to the devil stuff it will be a wake up moment i we hope wake up bosses..we love you too..wake up boss..then it is game over to the establishment hoaxers lol i and we hope this is the end game to all of this
hopefully esmeralda will save the cathedral
the ends comin and i think this time foreal
🎶burn baby burn
burn baby burn🎶
france is a failed state
why did n't god help the firefighters by making it rain
oh wait there is no god 😂
its about time god let that pagan building burn
symbolic of how god is judging the harlot church of rome
the way the first newscaster pronounces 'notre dame is extremely infuriating
some people did something
catholics burning their records
not surprised
5 of all of their priests molested kids regularly
yup
there goes the neighborhood
guys it was a terror attack
now we pagans will build a temple for us to praise the true gods on the ash of that useless building
do not forget christians have done this to every native belief for too long
skååååååååååål

typical nothing like seeing christian comments bashing another religion
calling this an accident huh
the seventh incarnation of god
let it burn

i bet the pagans will mourn the loss
survived 2 world wars and burns down due to a renovation error
obviously not all the facts are in yet but something already seems fishy
theres been a string of arsons in that area for a few months now
oh no my minecraft wood house who was the fker
nipsey hussle death has something to do with this
if only the same occured to mosques worldwide
empty trump towers deserve this treatment not the notre dame
😡😡😡😡😡
fear god
its a building and not important
just a building
where ’ s quasi
is esmeralda ok god
where ’ s quasi
i don ’ t understand why people crying
nobody killed
fire sprinklers save lives and buildings
but let me guess
you were grandfathered in were n't you
this is so sad
but somehow donald trump will be blamed
a mosque will probably be put in its place
its time to destory esau
we shall rebuild god wills it
why would god let this happen
let 's just say history repeats itself the yellow vest movement then the notre dame cathedral burnt little suspicious if you ask me only thing i 'm going to say germany reichstag
god is doing his job
not cool
keep it in the movies
there ’ s goes all the prof of children molesters

“ notre damn ”
probably done by the hunchback
donald trump came out singin billy joel
muslims were involved how do you burn stone
catholic churches have been vandalized for the last decade
it 's these invaders
the fire started 15 minutes after the last person left the church
is there a prediction told by nostradamus about this
now the trump cathedral is the tallest in paris
the house of satan himself burned 👇
laughs in german
import islam import terrorism
i heard they were rioting over there because of the economy and the media is trying to keep it quiet
so it wo n't spread
also i hope no one was hurt
buildings can be replaced people ca n't
let it burn
the art was a reminder..ppl have forgotten
why care for the art you never appreciated now thats its gone
immigration is at the root of why this happened
it means the end of superstition
it should be rebuild yet via vatican money
god burned it down thou shall not worship idols

it ’ s 2019
no sprinkler system
wtf
french protestors did this
not muslims 😂😂😂😂
burn baby burn
all those used condoms burning up in smoke
oh well
who put it on fire how horrible satanic def not on accident
can ’ t be renovated can ’ t be rebuilt
people i m telling the truth
this was done by turks because in april 24
there should have been a ceremony dedicated to the armenian genocide.turks have to be revenged
is sad
suation but the crown was not jesus
is just a hoaks
wait until the upper bosses at macy 's dillards cbs amazon etc wake up wait until this demon like possesion types wake up to wtf is going on the people know wtf is going on if the bosses do not listen to the base then it it game over to the awake masses such big time for humanity
it was built with blood money stone so why did it burn
religion of peace folks
nothing to see here
oh no
in china a mosque was destroyed by the chinese government days later fire sets ablaze to this cathedral
allah has given a warning and a sign
that he should burn down until the ground like the twintowers
let it burn its a building
side bets
arson
the slime that has infested paris and europe too probably will argue a mosque should be erected in its place mf n pos
never
is not a cathedral of love it was build upon hate
is the second time this cathedral burns
so you don ’ t steal oils from syria
who cares its not like france is a western christian nation anymore
people still have religions
no one cares about the structure what group or religion did this
the fire suggests that god does not like the pagan catholics
maybe
punition de dieu suite à vos mariages homosexuels là
this was not an accident or the last i promise that
a bunch of queer baits run the place god just started the place on fire
muslims at work
it ’ s the creeping sharia effect
wake up france

especially when it 's european news
😃
this was no accident
by muslims
for what for tourist to see
god probably struck this church since it has no other purpose other than to just attract tourists and not followers and believers
people donate already 100 million euro for a building
i dont care if it was a catholic islam or ghandi or any fantasy religion them believe in but where in the world millions of kids are starving you dont ever hear about
now it ’ s all going to be imports and mosques
about time to start christian crusades and whipe out libtards and browns
omg have you guys even been to paris lately its disgusting the smell of urine everywhere and a million africans trying to scam you every 5 mins let it burn its a freaking ghetto anyway
people i m telling the truth
this was done by turks because in april 24
there should have been a ceremony dedicated to the armenian genocide.turks have to be revenged

makes one think about all of those sons daughters mothers and fathers who cried because of the unneeded chaos destruction and death spawned by george junior in iraq and the middle east
the idea is to die young as late as possible
its not easy to do an eulogy for your parents especially with humor well done george well done
i remember watching a commercial that i think had arnold schwarzenegger in it and george h w bush in it when he was president advertising the usa
rip mr george h w bush sleep well sir
where some people have a father w had a dad
my father and i have n't always been close
it developed sadly after my mother passed
seeing this and sully the dog choked me up
rip 41
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

never easy seeing a man like w cry
you guys are being rude for putting ads through this ya know
did n't care for both bush but this eulogy reminds me again that we 're all only human
r.i.p
mr president
god bless the bush ’ s and god bless america

at the 5:10 minute mark that 's quite a juxtaposition of imagery and spoken word
it just disturbs me how media functions
facts and history almost have no bearing on the narrative anymore
if it is said on tv if it 's widely livestreamed it becomes reality
even if it 's not
just remember bush junior you just lost one relative there was a people in iraq then lost multiple relatives based on your lies on war on terror
i would have to say they are all definitely courageous
all of them
with him too

i miss this president
r.i.p
he was so stoic until the last 15 seconds
brought tears to my eyes
have no idea why drumpf even went
he sat there with his arms folded as if he was having a temper tantrump pun intended🤣 and made it awkward for everyone else

very emotional
lost records of george hw bush 's company
zapata 's filing records with the u.s securities and exchange commission are intact for the years 1955–1959 and again from 1967 onwards
however records for the years 1960–1966 are missing
the commission 's records officer stated that the records were inadvertently placed in a session file to be destroyed by a federal warehouse and that a total of 1,000 boxes were pulped in this procedure
the destruction of records occurred either in october 1983 according to the records officer or in 1981 shortly after bush became vice president of the united states according to wison carpenter a record analyst with the commission
they also established that the relationship involved both breaking mexican law and keeping us shareholders in the dark about the deal a violation of us law

i ca n't help but notice donald trump sat through this eulogy and other times during the service with his arms crossed and with a quizzical look or perhaps something else on his face
dab
고인의 명복을 빕니다
nothing like celbrating the death of a war criminal
even trump with his arms folded near the end of the eulogy and looking uncomfortable could n't have missed the irony in the contrast of their lives
ads on this

but for trump it is too late
we all have parents some living some long since gone
one day you will lose that opportunity and believe me you will miss it dearly
see now
people are living in suffering
if it was sadam hussein then you should have found another way to get rid of him and not to drag a nation into suffering
can cbs remove commercials for emotional things like this
trump 2020
dad also taught us how to invade
trump is the least qualified in that room and theres a dead man in there also
let that sink in.😐
the history books will remember you as a

the proof is in the pudding
are you listen trump i hope you learn something for those mans
fck trmp
is this a stand up comedy or a funeral

trump is like can i tweet
rip mr 'cop a feel
like father like son war monger
gw makes me sick
your dad was the cause of millions of deaths around the world
how does that feel
trump understand 18 of it and the rest did n't matter to him
mr twiter
like father like son full of crap and should have gone to jail
trump folded his arms after the remark of showing empathy he knew it was a message to him
i hope this can show trump some character
😴
i never like bush
his presidency was terrible but he always had a way to be a good joker
george w bush i disliked you as a president
come back
45 is disgraceing the office you and your father held
i ca n't believe that someday trump will get one of these i hope he was listening to the part about character and pedigree
thank god for president trump
rip bush
my father was a criminal so i am
shame they are n't both gone from this planet 😕
