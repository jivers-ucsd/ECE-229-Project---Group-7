believing in a democratic process could be not voting for trump but hoping he succeeds and believing in a democratic process also means believing congress controls the budget
trump modern day hitler
trump thinks he is the damn king and can do whatever he wants
lmao trump is without a doubt the dumbest president in u.s history
great job mr trump
good job trump love it maga2020 you know the dems hate it because they love those illegals and put them before the american people
emigration can be control with big penalty for hiring them trump is the biggest criminal in history of us..for many reasons dangerous sociopath
now the legal fight can begin to block trump 's attempt to use a faked emergency to over-ride congress constitutionally-protected power to control spending by the federal government
watch for more trump tweet-storms as his latest move of faking an emergency to end-run congress gets blocked by congressional committees and federal judges
it is not just the democrats in congress who disapprove of this latest trump scam
there are many republican members of congress who do not approve of trump 's attempt to reduce congressional power and undermine the separation of powers outlined in the us constitution
us voters will remember this this latest con job from the trump administration when they go to their polling stations in 2020
we totally agree with the president donald j trump in using anything that has in the hand of a super powerful nation in protecting the people of america
the problem with cbsn is its fake news like 93 of media if you people can ’ t hear the truth and president trump clear message of putting america first by making it safe you are all blind idiots full of pride a lot of people didn ’ t like trump when he first came into office but if you can ’ t understand all that he has done and is doing to make america great than i suggest you leave this country because you obviously have no respect for america and it ’ s people
i 've never seen a president from any party with the lack of depth to their answers or that repeats himself as much as trump
lol n trump is written in the stars til 2028/2030
lmao there are less expensive ways to have border security with drones and high tech surveillance if i know this then trump most definitely knows this
the boarder is older than trump
trump wants the death penalty for drug dealers
the usa courts will be busy with trump 's so called national emergency funds to build that wall
i love donald trump
it is so funny to me that the legislative body of this nation and governors and state attorney generals begin lawsuits once potus declared a state off emergency to get his border wall and keep in mind i am no supporter of president trump
trump is the best potus ever
trump harasses the press so much
trump and his 'very good relationships with korea and china we 're friends
what 's the point of the wall because as trump just admitted that when they come to the wall they ca n't get in unless they turn left or right and go through where there 's no wall
two of trump 's problems are time and space.another is knowing and reporting actual factual information in a coherent manner
what trump is saying is completely 100 the truth
i love president trump
haha go trump finish the wall 👏👏
the trump bots are in full force in these comments
or maybe you 're one of the uneducated trump loves so much
trump 's the true national threat
i blame donald j trump and steve bannon for the atmosphere that fosters this kind of madness
trump said there were good people on both sides of the shooting
donald trump enables far right terrorism
then i read the title of the story trump knows better than parisian firefighters
then trump tweets just dump water tankers on it wow we have a spart president
it was nice to see president trump send a plane to texas so the bush family go to washington god bless you trump
what a stark contrast the elder bush was to trump exact opposites
a very well thought out and poignant eulogy with some messages for trump
anyone using this as yet another excuse to bash trump should honestly consider swallowing a bottle of pills already
